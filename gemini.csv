"
Возмездие,1921,Blok,poems,"**Symbolism, Modernism, Drama** 

Here's why:

* **Symbolism:** The text is heavily reliant on symbols and imagery to convey its meaning. Examples include the hawk, the ""demon"" figure, the mazurka dance, and the city of Warsaw. These symbols carry deeper significance beyond their literal representation.
* **Modernism:** The poem grapples with themes of disillusionment, societal change, and the anxieties of the early 20th century. The fragmented narrative, focus on psychological introspection, and questioning of traditional values are hallmarks of modernist literature. 
* **Drama:**  While the text is a poem, it possesses strong dramatic elements. There's a clear narrative arc, developed characters, and scenes with dialogue that resemble stage directions, suggesting a dramatic presentation.

**Why the other genres are less fitting:**

* **Realism:** The poem focuses more on abstract ideas and psychological states than on realistic depictions of everyday life.
* **Romanticism:** While there's some emotional intensity, the poem lacks the idealism and focus on nature typical of Romanticism. 
* **Gothic:** The poem doesn't utilize the eerie atmospheres, supernatural elements, or focus on horror characteristic of the Gothic genre. 
* **Satire:** While Blok critiques certain aspects of society, the overall tone is more melancholic and introspective than satirical.
* **Romance:**  While there's a love story element, it's not the central focus and lacks the idealized conventions of the romance genre.
* **Mystery:** There's no central mystery driving the plot.
* **Naturalism:** The poem is more concerned with internal struggles and societal forces than with the detailed, objective observation of the natural world. 
"
19 октября,1825,Pushkin,poems,"The genres that best describe the text are: **romanticism, drama**. 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The poem is filled with strong emotions,  a focus on nature (the falling leaves, the fire), nostalgia for the past (memories of friends and school days), and themes of friendship, solitude, and longing. These are all hallmarks of Romanticism.
* **Drama:** The poem has a strong narrative element, telling the story of the speaker's isolation and yearning for his friends. It features emotional tension and conflict (the speaker's exile, the absence of his friends), creating a dramatic effect. 

While elements of realism (the description of the setting) and symbolism (the use of the seasons) can be found, romanticism and drama are the most prominent genres shaping the poem. 
"
Анчар,1828,Pushkin,poems,"**Romanticism, Symbolism** 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The poem emphasizes strong emotions (fear, awe), the power of nature, and exotic settings (the desert). There's also a focus on the individual's struggle against powerful forces (the slave against the ruler, humanity against the deadly tree).
* **Symbolism:** The ""Anchar"" tree is more than just a poisonous plant; it becomes a symbol of death, tyranny, and the destructive potential of unchecked power. The poem uses imagery and metaphor to create this deeper layer of meaning.

Let's address why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Realism:**  While the poem uses vivid descriptions, its focus on a fantastical poisonous tree makes it less grounded in realistic portrayals of everyday life.
* **Modernism:** Modernism tends towards fragmentation, stream-of-consciousness, and a questioning of traditional values. Pushkin's poem is more aligned with earlier Romantic ideals.
* **Gothic:** While there are elements of death and dread, the poem lacks the supernatural or macabre elements typical of Gothic literature. 
* **Satire:** There's an implicit critique of tyrannical power, but it's not the poem's primary focus.
* **Romance:** This refers to tales of chivalry and courtly love, which are absent from the poem.
* **Drama:** While there's a narrative, it's presented in poetic form rather than as a play with dialogue and characters meant for performance.
* **Mystery:** There's no central puzzle or question that needs solving.
* **Naturalism:** Naturalism emphasizes the deterministic forces of nature and society on individuals, while the poem focuses more on symbolic meaning.

Борис Годунов,1824,Pushkin,poems,"drama, romance 
"
Во глубине сибирских руд...,1827,Pushkin,poems,"**Romanticism, Naturalism** 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The poem emphasizes themes of hope, freedom, and the power of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The idealized image of ""love and friendship"" reaching the prisoners, along with the powerful imagery of ""heavy chains"" falling and ""dungeons crumbling"" are hallmarks of Romantic literature.
* **Naturalism:** The poem depicts the harsh reality of imprisonment in ""the depths of Siberian mines."" This focus on the brutal conditions and the prisoners' struggle for survival aligns with the Naturalist focus on portraying life as it is, without romanticization.

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Realism:** While the poem has realistic elements, its focus on grand themes and idealized concepts makes it less strictly ""realist"" than Romantic.
* **Symbolism:** While symbolism is present (e.g., ""chains"" representing oppression), it's not the dominant force driving the poem.
* **Modernism:** This poem predates the Modernist movement. 
* **Gothic:** The poem lacks the elements of the supernatural, mystery, and horror characteristic of Gothic literature. 
* **Satire:**  The poem is earnest and sincere, not satirical.
* **Romance:** While ""love"" is mentioned, it's not the central theme or a romantic relationship being explored.
* **Drama:** This is a lyrical poem, not a dramatic work with characters and dialogue. 
* **Mystery:** There is no mystery or puzzle to be solved within the poem.

Деревня,1819,Pushkin,poems,"realism, romanticism 
"
Евгений Онегин,1823,Pushkin,poems,"**Realism, Romanticism, Satire, Romance** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:**  The novel provides detailed descriptions of everyday life in both urban and rural settings. The characters face relatable issues like boredom, societal pressures, and the complexities of love.
* **Romanticism:** The work features elements like strong emotions, idealized love, and a focus on the inner world of the characters. The protagonist, Eugene Onegin, is a Byronic hero, characterized by melancholy and disillusionment.
* **Satire:**  Pushkin uses wit and irony to critique Russian society, particularly the superficiality and hypocrisy of the upper classes. The satirical tone is evident in descriptions of fashionable parties and the behavior of certain characters.
* **Romance:** The core of the story revolves around love and relationships. The novel explores the different facets of love: passionate infatuation (Tatiana for Onegin), innocent and playful love (Lensky and Olga), and the mature, complex emotions experienced by Tatiana and Onegin later. 

**The other genres are less prominent:**

* **Symbolism:** While there are some symbolic elements (like the use of the seasons), symbolism isn't a defining characteristic of the novel.
* **Modernism:** This genre emerged later and doesn't apply to Pushkin's work.
* **Gothic:** The novel lacks the elements of the supernatural, horror, and gloom that characterize the gothic genre.
* **Drama:**  While the work is structured in chapters and verse, it primarily functions as a narrative, not a play designed for the stage.
* **Mystery:**  There is no central mystery to be solved in the novel. 
* **Naturalism:** This genre emphasizes determinism and social forces shaping individuals, which is not the primary focus of ""Eugene Onegin."" 
"
Зимнее утро,1829,Pushkin,poems,"The genres that best describe Pushkin's ""Зимнее утро"" are: **romanticism, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The poem emphasizes emotion, beauty, and the power of nature.  Pushkin uses vivid imagery to depict the winter landscape and create a sense of awe and wonder. The poem also focuses on personal experience and feelings, especially the speaker's joy and desire to share it with his beloved.
* **Naturalism:** While less prominent than romanticism, the poem includes realistic descriptions of nature.  The details about the frozen river, the snow, and the frost-covered trees are presented with accuracy, grounding the poem in a tangible reality. 

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Realism:** While the poem includes realistic details, its main focus is not on portraying everyday life or social issues. 
* **Symbolism:** The poem uses imagery that evokes strong feelings, but these images don't have hidden or complex symbolic meanings.
* **Modernism:** Pushkin wrote long before the modernist movement.
* **Gothic:**  The poem lacks the dark, mysterious, and supernatural elements characteristic of Gothic literature.
* **Satire:**  The poem is not intended to criticize or ridicule anything.
* **Romance (as a genre):** While the poem is romantic in a general sense, it doesn't have the plot structure or focus on love and adventure typical of the romance genre.
* **Drama:**  The poem is lyrical, not dramatic. It doesn't involve dialogue or action designed for stage performance.
* **Mystery:**  There is no puzzle or crime to be solved in the poem.

К морю,1824,Pushkin,poems,"romanticism, drama 
"
К Чаадаеву,1818,Pushkin,poems,"The genres that best describe Pushkin's ""To Chaadaev"" are: **romanticism, symbolism**. 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The poem is filled with passionate emotion, idealism, and longing for liberty. It celebrates the ""beautiful impulses"" of the soul and the dedication to a noble cause (freedom for Russia).  The evocative imagery of ""dawn,"" ""star of captivating happiness,"" and the comparison to a ""young lover"" are all hallmarks of Romantic literature.
* **Symbolism:** The poem uses symbols like ""star"" and ""dawn"" to represent hope and a new era for Russia. The ""chains of power"" symbolize oppression, while ""freedom"" itself is a powerful symbol of change and liberation.

Let's consider why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Realism:**  While the poem addresses a real political situation, its focus is on emotional and idealistic aspirations rather than a gritty depiction of reality. 
* **Modernism:**  Pushkin predates the modernist movement.
* **Gothic:** The poem lacks the darkness, supernatural elements, and macabre themes associated with Gothic literature.
* **Satire:** There's no use of irony or mockery to criticize a specific target.
* **Romance:**  While the poem uses a romantic analogy, its primary focus is not on a love relationship.
* **Drama:** The poem is lyrical and reflective, not a dramatic narrative with dialogue and action.
* **Mystery:** There is no puzzle or crime to be solved. 
* **Naturalism:** This genre emphasizes scientific observation and social determinism, which are not present in the poem.

К,1825,Pushkin,poems,"Please provide the text you would like me to analyze. I need the text to determine the relevant genres. 😊 
"
Каменный гость,1830,Pushkin,poems,"**Drama, Romance** 

**Explanation:**

* **Drama:** The text is clearly a play, with dialogue, stage directions, and scenes.
* **Romance:**  The story revolves around a passionate and dramatic love affair between Don Juan and Dona Anna.  The text also features themes of seduction, betrayal, and revenge, which are common in romantic narratives. 

**While other genres might have subtle elements present, they are not the defining features of the text:**

* **Realism:** While the play deals with human emotions, its heightened dramatic style and supernatural elements push it away from realism. 
* **Romanticism:** Romanticism shares traits with the romance genre but often focuses on individualism, emotion, and the sublime. While some elements might be present, they don't dominate the text.
* **Symbolism:** There could be symbolic interpretations, but symbolism isn't the primary mode of storytelling. 
* **Modernism, Gothic, Naturalism:** These genres have distinct characteristics (like fragmentation in Modernism, horror in Gothic, and determinism in Naturalism) that are not prominent in this text.
* **Satire:** There might be satirical elements in how Don Juan is portrayed, but satire isn't the main focus. 
* **Mystery:** While there's suspense, the text doesn't primarily function as a mystery to be solved. 
"
Медный всадник,1833,Pushkin,poems,"**Realism, Romanticism, Symbolism** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The poem is rooted in a historical event (the St. Petersburg flood of 1824) and depicts the lives of ordinary people like Evgenii. The detailed descriptions of the city and the flood contribute to the realism.
* **Romanticism:**  The poem explores themes of intense emotions, the power of nature, the individual's struggle against fate, and the idealized (yet tragic) love between Evgenii and Parasha. The heightened language and dramatic storytelling are hallmarks of Romanticism.
* **Symbolism:** The ""Bronze Horseman"" (the statue of Peter the Great) is a powerful symbol of the state's power and ambition, contrasted with the vulnerability of the individual.  The flood itself can be interpreted as a symbol of the destructive forces of both nature and unchecked progress.

**Why the other genres are less fitting:**

* **Modernism:** Modernism came later and often features fragmentation, stream-of-consciousness, and a questioning of traditional values. ""The Bronze Horseman"" predates this movement.
* **Gothic:** Gothic literature emphasizes horror, the supernatural, and decay, which aren't the poem's primary focus.
* **Satire:** While the poem critiques the state's disregard for the individual, it's not primarily satirical in tone.
* **Romance:**  While a love story exists, it's not the central focus of the narrative. The poem delves into broader themes of societal impact.
* **Drama:** ""The Bronze Horseman"" is a narrative poem, not a play written for the stage.
* **Mystery:** There's no central mystery or crime to be solved in the poem.
* **Naturalism:** Naturalism emphasizes detached observation and the influence of heredity and environment. While the poem explores the power of nature, it's not solely focused on these elements in a detached way. 
"
Моцарт и Сальери,1830,Pushkin,poems,"**Drama, Romance** 

**Explanation:**

* **Drama:** The text is clearly a play, with dialogue, stage directions, and a focus on character interaction and conflict.
* **Romance:** While not a love story in the traditional sense, the play explores themes of passionate dedication to art, idealized genius, and the intense emotions surrounding artistic creation, which are characteristic of Romanticism.

**Why other genres are less suitable:**

* **Realism:**  While the play deals with human emotions, the heightened language and focus on exceptional individuals (Mozart and Salieri) move it away from strict realism.
* **Symbolism/Modernism:**  These genres often employ more abstract and experimental approaches, which are not present in Pushkin's relatively straightforward storytelling.
* **Gothic:** The play lacks the supernatural elements, macabre atmosphere, or focus on psychological extremes common to Gothic literature.
* **Satire:** There's no direct mockery or ridicule of social institutions or human behavior. 
* **Mystery:** While there's a brief mystery around the ""Requiem"" commissioner, it's not the central focus of the play. 
* **Naturalism:**  Naturalism emphasizes the influence of social and environmental factors on characters, while the play focuses on internal conflicts and individual genius. 
"
На холмах Грузии лежит ночная мгла...,1829,Pushkin,poems,"**Romanticism, Romance** 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The poem emphasizes emotion, individualism, and the beauty of nature (""На холмах Грузии лежит ночная мгла"", ""Шумит Арагва предо мною""). It explores themes of love, longing, and the power of the human heart. 
* **Romance:**  The poem is centered on a passionate, idealized love for an unnamed ""you"" (""Печаль моя полна тобою, / Тобой, одной тобой..."").  

The other genres are not a good fit:

* **Realism:**  The poem focuses on subjective emotions rather than a realistic depiction of everyday life.
* **Symbolism:** There isn't heavy use of symbols with deeper, hidden meanings.
* **Modernism:** This movement came later and focuses on disillusionment and breaking from tradition.
* **Gothic:**  There are no elements of darkness, horror, or the supernatural.
* **Satire:** The poem is sincere and not meant to ridicule or expose flaws.
* **Drama:**  While there's emotion, there's no dialogue or plot unfolding.
* **Mystery:** No puzzles or secrets need to be solved.
* **Naturalism:**  Naturalism focuses on scientific observation and determinism, which aren't present here.

Песнь о вещем Олеге,1822,Pushkin,poems,"romanticism, drama, naturalism 
"
Пир во время чумы,1830,Pushkin,poems,"**Drama, Romanticism, Gothic** 

**Explanation:**

* **Drama:** The text is written in the form of a play, with dialogue, stage directions, and a clear plot.
* **Romanticism:** The play explores themes of intense emotion, individualism, the sublime (the awe-inspiring power of death and disease), and the rejection of societal norms. The characters are driven by passion and instinct.
* **Gothic:** The setting (a plague-ridden city), the focus on death and decay, the presence of a ghostly apparition (the ""shadow"" of the Chairman's mother), and the overall atmosphere of morbidity and despair contribute to the gothic elements of the text. 

**Why the other genres are less fitting:**

* **Realism:** While the play deals with a realistic historical event (the plague), its focus on heightened emotions and dramatic situations makes it less focused on accurately depicting everyday life.
* **Symbolism:** There are symbolic elements, but they are not the dominant force driving the narrative.
* **Modernism:** The text lacks the fragmentation, alienation, and experimentation with form characteristic of modernism.
* **Satire:** The play doesn't primarily aim to ridicule or expose societal flaws.
* **Romance:** While there is a love story mentioned (Jenny and Edmond), it's not the central focus.
* **Mystery:** The text doesn't revolve around solving a puzzle or crime.
* **Naturalism:**  Naturalism emphasizes determinism and the influence of external forces on characters, whereas this play focuses on individual choices and emotional states.

Поэт,1827,Pushkin,poems,"Romanticism, Symbolism. 
"
Пророк,1826,Pushkin,poems,"The genres that best describe Alexander Pushkin's ""Пророк"" (""The Prophet"") are: **romanticism, symbolism**. 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The poem embodies key characteristics of Romanticism:
    * **Emphasis on emotion and the sublime:** The speaker's ""spiritual thirst,"" his awe-inspiring encounter with the seraph, and his transformation into a prophet all evoke strong emotions and a sense of the sublime.
    * **Focus on the individual and the power of imagination:** The poem centers on the speaker's personal, transformative experience and emphasizes the power of vision and prophecy.
    * **Connection to nature:** The setting of the ""bleak desert"" and the imagery of the ""earthly vine"" ground the poem in the natural world.

* **Symbolism:** The poem is rich in symbolism:
    * **The seraph:** Represents divine inspiration and the transformative power of poetic calling.
    * **The transformation of the speaker's senses:**  Symbolize the opening of the prophet's spiritual awareness and ability to perceive the world in a new light.
    * **The ""burning coal"" placed in the speaker's chest:** Represents the fiery passion and truth that the prophet must convey.

While other genres might have some minor resonance, they are not as central to the poem's overall meaning and style:

* **Realism:** The poem's focus on a supernatural experience and symbolic language makes realism less relevant.
* **Modernism, Gothic, Satire, Romance, Mystery, Naturalism:** These genres have elements that are not present or central to the poem's themes and style. 
"
Сказка о золотом петушке,1834,Pushkin,poems,"The best fitting genres for ""The Tale of the Golden Cockerel"" are: **satire, romance, symbolism**. 

Here's why:

* **Satire:** The story uses humor and exaggeration to criticize Tsar Dadon's foolishness, greed, and lust for power. This is evident in his obsession with the beautiful queen, his disregard for his sons' deaths, and his violent reaction to the astrologer's request.
* **Romance:** The story features elements of courtly love and adventure, including exotic settings, beautiful women, and heroic deeds (albeit ultimately unsuccessful). The Tsar's infatuation with the Queen, the magical tent, and the journey to the East all contribute to this genre.
* **Symbolism:** The Golden Cockerel acts as a powerful symbol of warning and prophecy, representing the dangers of ignoring wise counsel. The Queen also embodies temptation and the allure of the exotic, while the Tsar represents the folly of unchecked ambition.

While elements of other genres might be present, they are not as prominent:

* **Realism:** The story is clearly fantastical and allegorical, not concerned with depicting everyday life realistically.
* **Romanticism:** While there are romantic elements, the story focuses more on satire and symbolism than on emotional intensity or individualism.
* **Modernism:**  The story predates modernist themes of alienation and social critique.
* **Gothic:** The story lacks the darkness, horror, and supernatural elements typical of the gothic genre.
* **Drama:** While there is conflict and tragedy, the story is narrated, not primarily structured for stage performance.
* **Mystery:**  The story focuses on moral and social themes, not suspense or solving a puzzle. 
* **Naturalism:** The story does not aim for scientific objectivity or focus on determinism and social forces.

Скупой рыцарь,1830,Pushkin,poems,"**drama, romanticism** 

**Explanation:**

* **Drama:** The text is clearly a play, evident from the scene descriptions, character interactions, and dialogue format.
* **Romanticism:**  The themes of strong emotions (greed, rage, despair), individualism (Albert's rebellion), and the focus on the inner lives of the characters (especially the Baron's obsession) align with Romantic ideals. 

**Why other genres are less fitting:**

* **Realism:** While some aspects might seem realistic (poverty, family conflict), the heightened emotions and dramatic situations lean more towards Romanticism.
* **Symbolism:**  There isn't a heavy use of symbols with deeper meanings beyond the literal.
* **Modernism:** This text predates Modernism, lacking its characteristic fragmentation, alienation, and experimentation.
* **Gothic:**  While there's darkness, the text lacks the supernatural or macabre elements typical of Gothic literature.
* **Satire:** The play criticizes greed, but its focus is more on dramatic conflict than outright mockery.
* **Romance:** While there's a hint of potential romance with Albert and Clotilde, it's not a central focus of the excerpt.
* **Mystery:** There's no central puzzle or crime to be solved.
* **Naturalism:** This genre emphasizes social determinism, which isn't the primary driver of the plot. 
"
Узник,1822,Pushkin,poems,"**Romanticism, Symbolism, Drama** 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The poem emphasizes emotional expression, individualism, and a yearning for freedom. The speaker's longing for liberty and connection with the natural world (the eagle) are central to Romantic themes. 
* **Symbolism:** The eagle is a powerful symbol of freedom, contrasting sharply with the imprisoned speaker. The imagery of flight, mountains, and the sea evokes a sense of boundless possibility that is out of reach for the speaker.
* **Drama:** The poem presents a tense and emotional situation: a prisoner longing for freedom. The speaker's direct address to the eagle and the eagle's ""response"" create a dramatic dialogue within the poem.

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Realism:** While the poem depicts a realistic situation (imprisonment), the focus is on emotional and symbolic meaning rather than gritty, social realism.
* **Modernism:**  Modernism tends toward fragmentation and disillusionment, whereas this poem has a more traditional structure and Romantic yearning. 
* **Gothic:**  Gothic literature usually involves elements of horror, the supernatural, and decay, which are absent here.
* **Satire:**  The poem lacks the wit and irony characteristic of satire. It's focused on sincere emotion.
* **Romance:** While the poem is romantic in style, it doesn't fit the genre of ""Romance"" which usually involves a love story or chivalric adventures.
* **Mystery:** There's no puzzle or crime to be solved in the poem.
* **Naturalism:**  Naturalism emphasizes the deterministic power of nature and social forces on individuals.  The focus here is more on internal emotions and symbolic meaning.

"
Элегия (Воспоминаньем упоенный...),1819,Pushkin,poems,"The best fitting genres for the given text are: **romanticism**. 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:**  The poem emphasizes emotion (""воспоминаньем упоенный"", ""благоговеньем и тоской""), a personal connection to the past, and a sense of awe towards nature and history (""грозный мрамор твой""). These are all hallmarks of Romanticism. 
* **Elegy:**  The very title identifies the poem as an elegy, a mournful, melancholic poem that often reflects on themes of loss, mortality, and the passage of time.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **Realism:** Realism aims for objective representation of everyday life, which isn't the focus of this poem.
* **Symbolism:** Symbolism utilizes heavy use of symbols with layered meanings, not as prominently featured here.
* **Modernism:**  Modernism often breaks from traditional forms and explores themes of alienation and disillusionment, which doesn't align with this poem.
* **Gothic:** Gothic literature focuses on the macabre, supernatural, and suspense.
* **Satire:** Satire uses humor to critique society or individuals, which isn't present in the poem. 
* **Romance:** While ""romance"" can mean a love story, in literary terms it refers to a medieval tale of chivalry, which isn't the case here.
* **Drama:**  Drama primarily refers to plays intended for performance.
* **Mystery:**  Mystery involves suspense and the unraveling of a secret or crime.
* **Naturalism:** Naturalism presents a deterministic view of life, heavily influenced by scientific thought, which isn't a primary theme in the poem.

Элегия на смерть Анны Львовны,1825,Pushkin,poems,"**Romanticism, Elegy** 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The poem emphasizes emotion, sentimentality, and a personal connection to the deceased. This is characteristic of the Romantic era.
* **Elegy:** An elegy is a poem of mourning, usually for a specific person. The title itself declares this (""Elegy on the Death of Anna Lvovna"").

Let's look at why the other options don't fit:

* **Realism:** While the poem references real people, its focus is not on presenting a gritty, objective portrayal of life. 
* **Symbolism:** There's no overt use of symbols to represent abstract ideas.

* **Gothic:** The poem lacks the dark, supernatural, or macabre elements of Gothic literature.

"Я вас любил любовь ещё, быть может,...",1829,Pushkin,poems,"**Romanticism, Romance, Drama** 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The poem emphasizes emotion, particularly the speaker's deep and enduring love. It idealizes love as a powerful force, even if unrequited.
* **Romance:**  The poem centers on the theme of love, specifically a past love that continues to affect the speaker. 
* **Drama:** The poem presents a conflict - the speaker's struggle with his lingering feelings and his desire not to burden the beloved.  There's an inherent tension in this situation.

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Realism:** The poem doesn't focus on gritty everyday life or social issues.
* **Symbolism:** While there might be subtle symbolic interpretations, the poem primarily uses direct emotional expression.
* **Modernism:**  This poem predates modernism, which is characterized by disillusionment and experimentation with form.
* **Gothic:**  There's no element of horror, the supernatural, or a dark atmosphere.
* **Satire:** The poem is sincere, not mocking or critical.
* **Mystery:** There's no puzzle or crime to be solved.
* **Naturalism:** This genre focuses on the influence of external forces on characters, which isn't the primary focus here. 
"
Я памятник себе воздвиг нерукотворный,1836,Pushkin,poems,"The genres that best describe the text are: **romanticism, symbolism**. 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The poem emphasizes the power of individual emotion and expression (""душа в заветной лире""), the pursuit of freedom (""восславил я Свободу""), and the enduring nature of art (""Я памятник себе воздвиг нерукотворный""). These are all key themes of Romanticism. 
* **Symbolism:** The ""monument"" itself is a symbol of the poet's legacy and the lasting impact of his work. This focus on symbolic meaning is characteristic of Symbolism.

While the poem touches on themes of legacy and mortality, it doesn't delve into the psychological realism, social critique, or formal experimentation associated with naturalism or modernism. Similarly, it lacks the elements of mystery, satire, romance, gothic, or drama typically associated with those genres.

"
Бессмысленные мечтания,1891,Tolstoy,publicism,"The best fitting genres for the text you provided are: 

**Realism, satire, naturalism**

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text focuses on depicting the socio-political realities of Russia in 1895. It portrays the lives and thoughts of ordinary people, particularly their dissatisfaction with the Tsar's autocratic rule. The detailed description of the delegation, their preparations, and the Tsar's reception aims for a sense of authenticity and believability. 
* **Satire:** The author uses irony and sarcasm to critique the Tsar's actions and the societal response. He mocks the Tsar's claim of ""dedicating all his powers to the people's good"" while simultaneously suppressing their voices. The elaborate description of the delegates' submissive acceptance of the Tsar's insults is also satirical, highlighting the absurdity of the situation.
* **Naturalism:** The text presents a deterministic view of society, suggesting that individuals are shaped and controlled by external forces. The comparison of the Tsar to a spoiled child and the focus on the self-serving motives of officials hint at a naturalistic perspective, where human agency is limited by social and political structures. 

While elements of other genres might be present, they are not as prominent:

* **Romanticism:** The text lacks the focus on individualism, emotionality, and the idealization of nature often found in romanticism.
* **Symbolism:**  While the text uses metaphors (e.g., the worker and the boy), it doesn't heavily rely on symbols to convey deeper meaning.
* **Modernism:** The text predates the characteristic features of modernism, such as fragmentation, stream of consciousness, and experimentation with form.

Богу или маммоне,1895,Tolstoy,publicism,"**Realism, Naturalism** 

**Explanation:**

* **Realism:** The text focuses on the social issue of alcohol consumption and its consequences, portraying it in a straightforward and realistic manner. It describes the lives of ordinary people and their struggles with alcohol, highlighting the negative impact on individuals, families, and society as a whole.
* **Naturalism:**  The text presents a deterministic view of human behavior, suggesting that individuals are heavily influenced by their environment and circumstances. It implies that alcohol consumption is not simply a matter of personal choice but is driven by social pressures and economic hardship. 

**Why other genres are less suitable:**

* **Romanticism:** The text lacks the idealized characters, heightened emotions, or focus on nature characteristic of Romanticism.
* **Symbolism:** While the text uses biblical quotes, it doesn't employ symbols in a complex or layered way to convey hidden meanings.

Два письма к М.Ганди,1909,Tolstoy,publicism,"The text provided is best described by these genres: 

**realism, naturalism** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Tolstoy focuses on real-world issues like social injustice, violence, and the role of religion in society. His letters address concrete problems and offer practical solutions.
* **Naturalism:**  He emphasizes the power of larger forces shaping individual lives and choices. The letters explore how societal structures and inherent human tendencies influence individual behavior, particularly regarding violence and resistance.

Let's consider why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Romanticism:** While Tolstoy expresses deep conviction and idealism, his focus on social critique and tangible solutions veers away from the emotional intensity and focus on the individual characteristic of Romanticism. 
* **Symbolism:** There's little use of symbolism or metaphorical language aimed at conveying abstract ideas. 
* **Modernism:** Tolstoy's writing predates the key stylistic and thematic innovations of Modernism.
* **Gothic, Satire, Romance, Drama, Mystery:** These genres contain elements (supernatural, humor, love stories, staged conflict, suspense) that are not present in Tolstoy's letters.

**Realism, Naturalism** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text tackles a very real and pressing issue of war and its devastating impact on humanity. It doesn't shy away from depicting the harsh realities of war and the moral dilemmas it poses.  
* **Naturalism:**  The text explores the idea that human actions are often driven by forces beyond their control, such as societal structures and the influence of powerful institutions (governments, military). This aligns with the naturalist view of humans being subject to the pressures of their environment and social forces. 

Let's look at why the other genres aren't the best fit:

* **Romanticism:** The text lacks the idealism, emotional intensity, and focus on individual expression characteristic of Romanticism.
* **Symbolism:** While there might be some symbolic language, it's not the dominant feature of the text. Symbolism usually relies on heavily layered metaphors and imagery.

* **Gothic:** There are no elements of horror, supernatural, or the macabre, which are typical of Gothic literature.

* **Romance:**  There is no focus on romantic love or relationships.

* **Mystery:** The text doesn't revolve around solving a puzzle or uncovering a secret.

* **Modernism:** The text also displays elements of modernism, particularly in its focus on individual experience, psychological introspection, and questioning of traditional values and beliefs. The narrator's existential crisis, his search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world, and his rejection of conventional societal structures are characteristic of modernist literature.

* **Mystery:**  There is no central mystery or investigation driving the narrative. 
* **Naturalism:** Naturalism often emphasizes the influence of social and environmental factors on individuals. While the narrator's experience is shaped by his social context, the text doesn't focus on deterministic forces in the same way as naturalism.

Tolstoy dissects the arguments for and against religious tolerance, presenting a grounded, logical critique of the church's position.
* **Satire:** Tolstoy employs sharp wit and irony to expose the hypocrisy and self-serving interests of the church. He ridicules the church's claims of divine authority and its use of violence to maintain power, highlighting the absurdity of its doctrines and the contradictions in its actions.

Первая ступень,1891,Tolstoy,publicism,"The text you provided is best described by these genres: **realism, naturalism, satire**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Tolstoy focuses on depicting everyday life and the struggles of ordinary people grappling with moral questions. His description of the slaughterhouse, the detailed account of a typical day for a person living in luxury, and the portrayal of Ogarev's internal conflict all aim for a realistic representation of human experience.
* **Naturalism:** Tolstoy explores how social conditions and biological drives influence human behavior, particularly regarding the consumption of meat and the pursuit of comfort. This focus on the deterministic aspects of human life aligns with naturalism. 
* **Satire:** Tolstoy critiques the hypocrisy and moral inconsistency of his contemporary society. He satirizes the upper class's pursuit of pleasure and comfort while claiming moral superiority, highlighting the dissonance between their professed values and their actions.

* **Satire:** The text critiques intellectual elites and their elaborate theories for societal improvement, arguing that they ignore the root cause of the problem (violence and coercion). This pointed critique, especially regarding the ""mountains of books"" and ""empty, useless, and even harmful writings,"" has a satirical edge. 

While the text touches upon themes of religion and morality, it does not delve into the emotional and spiritual exploration typical of **romanticism**. There's no use of evocative imagery or metaphorical language that characterizes **symbolism**. The text lacks the experimental form and focus on subjective experience common to **modernism**.

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text focuses on a real-world issue (conscription and the morality of war) and presents it in a straightforward, unidealized manner. It portrays the social and political realities of the time, such as economic inequality and the role of the national guard in suppressing workers' rights.

"
Удивительные существа,1909,Tolstoy,publicism,"The text is best described by these genres: **satire, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Satire:** The text uses biting humor and exaggeration to critique human behavior and societal structures. It highlights the absurdity of human actions, beliefs, and institutions. The description of humans dividing land for their detriment, blindly following authority, engaging in destructive wars, and clinging to nonsensical traditions is clearly satirical.
* **Naturalism:** The text presents a pessimistic view of humanity, emphasizing its base instincts and the deterministic forces that shape its behavior. Humans are portrayed as driven by primal urges, trapped in cycles of suffering, and incapable of true progress. The emphasis on the struggle for survival, the focus on the negative consequences of reproduction, and the portrayal of humans as animals driven by instinct all align with naturalism.

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

Бедные люди,1846,Dostoevsky,prose,"The text you provided is best described by the following genres: **realism, satire, drama, naturalism**. Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on the daily lives and struggles of poor, ordinary people like Makar Devushkin and Varvara Dobroselova. Their financial difficulties, social anxieties, and the bleakness of their environment are depicted with a high degree of detail and psychological depth, characteristic of realist literature.
* **Satire:** The text subtly satirizes social conventions, literary trends, and the superficiality of the wealthy.  For example, Makar's obsession with his clothing and his misinterpretation of Ratzyaev's writing style are presented humorously, highlighting the absurdity of societal expectations and the  gap between the lives of the poor and the rich. 
* **Drama:** The story is intensely emotional and driven by the characters' internal conflicts and their desperate circumstances. The readers are emotionally invested in the characters' well-being, creating a dramatic tension throughout the narrative. 
* **Naturalism:** The text exhibits elements of naturalism by suggesting that the characters are trapped by their social and economic conditions, lacking control over their fate. The story's emphasis on the deterministic forces shaping their lives, including poverty, illness, and social prejudice, aligns with the principles of naturalism.

While the text features **romantic** elements in the relationship between Makar and Varvara, it ultimately avoids idealized portrayals of love and focuses on the harsh realities of their situation, making **realism** a more dominant genre.  Similarly, while there are moments of suspense and mystery surrounding Varvara's past and her relationship with Bykov, the focus remains on the social and psychological realism of the characters' lives, making **mystery** a less prominent genre.

* **Drama:**  The narrative is driven by conflict, tension, and strong emotional undercurrents. The stark contrast between the innocent young girl and the calculating Julian Mastakovich creates a dramatic arc that culminates in the unsettling wedding scene. 

Let's look at why the other genres are less suitable:

However, ""Идиот"" is also the title of a famous novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky.  If you meant the novel, the applicable genres would be: 

**Realism, Symbolism, Drama, Naturalism** 
"
Короткая,1876,Dostoevsky,prose,"realism, drama, naturalism 
"
Крокодил,1865,Dostoevsky,prose,"The best genres to describe the text are: **realism, satire, naturalism**. Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story depicts everyday life in St. Petersburg, with details about locations, professions, and social issues. The characters also behave and speak in a way that reflects their social status and individual personalities.
* **Satire:** The story heavily satirizes societal obsessions with progress, Europeanization, and economic principles. The characters' absurd actions and justifications highlight the ridiculousness of blind faith in these concepts. 
* **Naturalism:** While not the dominant element, the story touches upon the idea of deterministic forces shaping human life. Ivan Matveich's predicament in the crocodile, despite his attempts at rationalizing it, reflects a somewhat deterministic perspective on his fate. 

While other genres like **romanticism** and **symbolism** may have faint echoes, they are not central to the text's core themes and structure. The story lacks the idealism of romanticism and the heavy reliance on symbolic imagery characteristic of symbolism. Similarly, **modernism** is not a fitting label, as the story doesn't showcase the fragmented, experimental style typical of that movement. 
"
Маленький герой,1857,Dostoevsky,prose,"**Realism, Romanticism, Romance, Drama** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on everyday life and social dynamics in a Russian country estate setting. The characters, their interactions, and even the gossip are presented with a sense of believability. 
* **Romanticism:** The narrator's intense emotions, his idealized view of Mme M*, the dramatic encounter with the horse, and the focus on nature's beauty all point to Romantic themes.
* **Romance:**  The story centers on a young boy's infatuation with an older woman, creating a romantic storyline, even if unrequited.
* **Drama:** The story is full of dramatic tension, particularly surrounding Mme M*'s secret and the narrator's attempt to help her.  The scene with the horse and the climax with the letter are highly dramatic.

**Why the other genres are less fitting:**

* **Symbolism:** While some potential symbolic interpretations could be made, the story isn't driven by overt symbolism as a primary feature.
* **Modernism:**  This story predates Modernist literary trends. It lacks the fragmentation, stream-of-consciousness, or self-conscious experimentation common to Modernism.
* **Gothic:**  The story lacks the elements of the Gothic, such as supernatural events, a dark and foreboding atmosphere, or psychological torment.
* **Satire:** While there's some gentle social commentary, especially about the ""idle rich,"" the story isn't primarily satirical. 
* **Mystery:** Although there's a sense of mystery surrounding Mme M*, the story ultimately focuses more on the narrator's experience and isn't a true mystery narrative.
* **Naturalism:**  Naturalism emphasizes the deterministic forces of nature and society on individuals. While the story touches on social dynamics, it doesn't fully embrace a naturalist perspective.

"
Неточка Незванова,1849,Dostoevsky,prose,"The text you provided from Dostoevsky's ""Netochka Nezvanova"" exhibits characteristics of the following genres:

**realism, drama, mystery, romance** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Dostoevsky is known for his psychological realism, and this excerpt demonstrates that. The detailed descriptions of poverty, the characters' complex inner lives, and the portrayal of societal issues all contribute to the realism of the story.
* **Drama:**  The excerpt is filled with dramatic tension and conflict. The intense arguments between Netochka's parents, the dramatic events surrounding her father's decline, and the confrontation with Petr Alexandrovich create a strong sense of drama.
* **Mystery:** The excerpt introduces a central mystery – the nature of Alexandra Mikhailovna's past relationship and the secret behind her husband's behavior. The letter Netochka finds adds to the mystery and raises questions about the characters' motivations.
* **Romance:** Netochka's intense, passionate love for Katya is a significant element of the story and leans into the genre of romance, specifically highlighting the complexities of a young girl's developing emotions. 

While the text touches on elements of other genres like naturalism and gothic, they are not the primary driving forces of the narrative. 
"
Петербургские сновидения в стихах и в прозе,1861,Dostoevsky,prose,"The text is best described by the following genres: **realism, satire**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Dostoevsky vividly depicts the everyday life of St. Petersburg, focusing on the struggles of ordinary people, poverty, social issues, and bureaucratic absurdity. The detailed descriptions of the city, the characters' living conditions, and their internal thoughts ground the story in a recognizable reality. 
* **Satire:** The narrator uses irony, humor, and exaggeration to criticize various aspects of society.  He mocks the superficiality of the wealthy, the hypocrisy of ""philanthropists,"" the obsession with trends like Ristori, and the pointless routines of the bureaucratic world. He also satirizes journalistic practices and the shallowness of some writers.

While the text includes elements of other genres:

* **Romanticism:** The narrator's sentimental reflections on his youth, his idealized view of Amalia, and his escapist fantasies hint at romantic tendencies.
* **Symbolism:**  Moments like the narrator's ""vision"" on the Neva and his recurring dreams suggest a deeper, possibly symbolic, meaning. 

However, realism and satire are the most prominent and defining characteristics of the text. 
"
Подросток,1875,Dostoevsky,prose,"The text above best fits the following genres: **realism, romanticism, drama, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text focuses on portraying characters and their situations in a way that feels authentic and relatable. It delves into their psychology, motivations, and internal struggles, emphasizing the complexity of human nature. The detailed descriptions of everyday life and social dynamics further contribute to the realistic feel.
* **Romanticism:** The protagonist, Arkady, displays characteristically romantic traits like passionate idealism, a thirst for individualism, and a fascination with grand ideas like ""finding his place"" and achieving ""power and solitude."" His tumultuous emotional states, introspective musings, and focus on subjective experience further align with romanticism.
* **Drama:** The text is driven by intense conflicts between characters, their internal struggles, and the challenging circumstances they face.  The heightened emotional intensity, dramatic confrontations, and the tragic events like suicide and betrayal contribute to the dramatic nature of the narrative.
* **Naturalism:**  The text exhibits naturalistic elements through its focus on the influence of social and environmental factors on the characters' lives.  Their poverty, social status, and the constricting norms of society are presented as forces that shape their choices and destinies. The emphasis on deterministic factors and the bleakness of some events also lean towards naturalism.

While the text touches upon elements of other genres like **satire** and **mystery**, they are not as prominent as the four listed above.  The satirical elements are mostly limited to the protagonist's critical observations of society and individuals, while the mystery aspect is more about unraveling the complexities of the characters' motivations and actions than a plot driven by a specific enigma. 
"
Ползунков,1848,Dostoevsky,prose,"realism, satire, drama 
"
Роман в девяти письмах,1847,Dostoevsky,prose,"**Realism, Satire** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on everyday life and relationships, particularly the complexities and misunderstandings that can arise in social interactions. The characters are ordinary people with relatable flaws and motivations.
* **Satire:** The text uses humor and irony to critique social behaviors, particularly hypocrisy, greed, and the superficiality of appearances. The escalating misunderstandings and absurd situations create a satirical commentary on the characters' actions and values. 

Let's address why the other genres aren't as fitting:

* **Romanticism:** There's a lack of emphasis on strong emotions, idealism, or the glorification of nature.
* **Symbolism:**  The story doesn't rely heavily on symbols to convey deeper meanings.
* **Modernism:**  It doesn't exhibit the experimentation with form, fragmentation, or psychological focus often found in modernism.
* **Gothic:**  The story lacks the elements of the supernatural, horror, or bleak atmosphere associated with the gothic genre.
* **Romance:** While there are romantic relationships in the background, the primary focus is not on romantic love.
* **Drama:** While the story has dramatic elements, it is presented as a narrative through letters rather than a play.
* **Mystery:** While there is some initial mystery surrounding the characters' motivations, it's not the driving force of the plot.
* **Naturalism:** The story lacks the deterministic and scientific approach to character and society that defines naturalism. 
"
Село Степанчиково и его обитатели,1859,Dostoevsky,prose,"The text provided is a part of ""The Village of Stepanchikovo and Its Inhabitants"" by Fyodor Dostoevsky. The best fitting genres from your list are:

**realism, satire, drama** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Dostoevsky is a master of realism, depicting characters and situations with psychological depth and social relevance. The text focuses on believable characters, their relationships, and their struggles within a specific social context (rural Russian society). 
* **Satire:** The portrayal of Foma Fomich and the general absurdity of the situations in the household clearly aim to satirize human flaws like vanity, hypocrisy, and blind obedience. The exaggerated characters and their ridiculous actions contribute to the satirical tone.
* **Drama:**  The text is filled with dramatic tension and conflict. The power struggles within the household, the romantic entanglements, and the emotional outbursts of the characters create a strong dramatic element.

While elements of other genres might be present, these three are the most prominent in the excerpt. 
"
Скверный анекдот,1862,Dostoevsky,prose,"The genres that best describe ""A Nasty Anecdote"" by Fyodor Dostoevsky are: 

**realism, satire, naturalism**

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on portraying everyday life, particularly the social dynamics and anxieties of Russian bureaucracy in the period of reform. The characters are believable and flawed, and their interactions reflect the complexities of their social positions.
* **Satire:** Dostoevsky uses humor and irony to critique the hypocrisy and self-importance of  general  Ivan Ilyich Prakinsky.  Prakinsky's grand ideas about ""humaneness"" clash hilariously with the realities of the wedding party he attends.  The story mocks his ambition and misplaced sense of superiority. 
* **Naturalism:** The story emphasizes the influence of social and economic circumstances on the characters' lives, especially the poverty and desperation of Pseldonimov. Dostoevsky realistically depicts the squalor and bleakness of their living conditions, highlighting the deterministic forces shaping their fate. 

While the story contains elements of drama, there isn't a central conflict structured for theatrical performance, and the focus on social commentary outweighs romantic or mystery elements. The text doesn't delve into the mystical or symbolic like Symbolism or the fragmented, subjective perspectives common in Modernism. It lacks the elements of horror and suspense associated with Gothic literature.

"
Хозяйка,1847,Dostoevsky,prose,"The genres that best describe the text above are: **realism, romanticism, mystery, drama**.

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story depicts the everyday life of ordinary people in St. Petersburg, focusing on their struggles, anxieties, and relationships. The detailed descriptions of the city and the characters' living conditions contribute to a sense of realism.
* **Romanticism:** The story features a strong emphasis on intense emotions, such as Ordynov's passionate love for Katerina, her mysterious past, and the dramatic tension between the characters. The poetic language and evocative imagery add to the romantic atmosphere.
* **Mystery:** Katerina's backstory and her connection with Murin are shrouded in secrecy, creating a sense of intrigue and suspense. The reader is constantly guessing about their true identities, motivations, and the nature of their relationship.
* **Drama:** The story is filled with dramatic confrontations, intense dialogues, and emotional outbursts. The climax, where Ordynov threatens Murin with a knife, is particularly dramatic and highlights the heightened tension between the characters.

While the story contains elements of other genres, such as symbolism and gothic, these are not as prominent as the four listed above. The story doesn't delve deeply into symbolic meanings, and the gothic elements (the dark, isolated setting, the hints of violence) are more subtle and serve to enhance the atmosphere of mystery and drama.

Честный вор,1860,Dostoevsky,prose,"realism, naturalism 
"
Чужая жена и муж под кроватью,1848,Dostoevsky,prose,"The phrase ""Чужая жена и муж под кроватью"" (Someone else's wife and husband under the bed) suggests a scenario ripe with intrigue and potential conflict.  Therefore, the following genres apply:

**drama, mystery** 

Let's break down why:

* **Drama:** The situation inherently presents a high-stakes conflict. A hidden husband suggests infidelity, secrecy, and the potential for explosive consequences. 
* **Mystery:** The phrase leaves many questions unanswered. *Whose* wife is it? *Why* is the husband under the bed? What led to this situation, and what will happen next? This inherent ambiguity points towards mystery. 

Let's address why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Realism:** While the situation is plausible, the phrase lacks the detailed, everyday context that defines realism.
* **Romanticism:** There's no immediate indication of idealized love, heightened emotion, or the supernatural often found in Romanticism.
* **Symbolism:** The phrase doesn't use objects or characters to represent abstract ideas in a clearly symbolic way.
* **Modernism:**  While secrecy and betrayal are common modernist themes, the phrase lacks the experimental style or psychological focus often found in modernist literature.
* **Gothic:**  There's no sense of the macabre, supernatural, or decay that characterize Gothic literature.
* **Satire:** The phrase lacks the wit or irony needed for satire. It seems more likely to be a setup for serious conflict than a critique of society or human behavior.
* **Romance:** While adultery is a common plot device in romance, the phrase emphasizes secrecy and potential conflict rather than romantic love.
* **Naturalism:** Naturalism focuses on gritty realism and social determinism, which aren't immediately apparent in the phrase.

"
Анна на шее,1895,Chekhov,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, satire, drama, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on portraying everyday life in Russia at the time, depicting social hierarchies, financial struggles, and the complexities of relationships. 
* **Satire:** Chekhov subtly mocks societal norms and power dynamics. The portrayal of Modest Alexeich, his obsession with status, and his condescending lectures are inherently satirical. The ending, where his achievement is reduced to a pun by his superior, further underscores this element. 
* **Drama:** The story revolves around the dramatic circumstances of Anya's life, her unhappy marriage, her father's alcoholism, and her own internal conflicts.
* **Naturalism:** The story presents a rather pessimistic view of human nature, highlighting how individuals are shaped and often trapped by their social and economic circumstances. Anya's initial hope and happiness are gradually eroded by the realities of her situation. 

While elements of romance exist in Anya's initial hope for a better life and her flirtations with other men, the story primarily focuses on the harsh realities of her situation and the societal pressures that bind her. Therefore, romance is not a primary genre for this story.

"Ах, зубы",1886,Chekhov,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, satire, drama**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on a mundane, everyday experience (toothache) and portrays it in a relatable and believable way. The characters, their reactions, and the setting are all presented realistically.
* **Satire:** The story uses humor and exaggeration to poke fun at several targets: the ineffective home remedies, the absurdity of the waiting room experience, and the ultimate mistake of going to the wrong professional. These elements create a satirical critique of societal practices and human behavior.
* **Drama:** The story features a heightened sense of tension and urgency stemming from the protagonist's excruciating pain. His desperate search for relief and the series of unfortunate events contribute to the dramatic element. 

While there are elements of other genres:

* **Naturalism:** The emphasis on suffering and the protagonist's lack of control over his situation could be seen as naturalistic, but it's not the dominant mode.
* **Humor:**  The story is certainly funny, but the humor serves a satirical purpose rather than simply aiming for lightheartedness.

The other genres (romanticism, symbolism, modernism, gothic, romance, mystery) are not significantly present in the text.

Беглец,1887,Chekhov,prose,"The best fitting genres from your list for ""The Runaway"" by Anton Chekhov are: **realism, naturalism, drama**. Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on portraying everyday life experiences, particularly those of lower-class individuals.  The descriptions of the hospital, the characters' appearances and dialogue, and the protagonist's simple desires all contribute to a sense of gritty authenticity.
* **Naturalism:**  The story emphasizes the influence of external forces on characters' lives.  Пашка's fate is largely determined by poverty, lack of education, and his mother's negligence. His vulnerability and powerlessness in the face of these factors are characteristic of naturalism. 
* **Drama:** The story creates a strong sense of tension and suspense. The reader experiences Пашка's fear and confusion, culminating in his dramatic escape and subsequent collapse. The events unfold in a way that elicits emotional engagement from the audience. 

While the story has elements of satire (critique of the healthcare system) and aspects of symbolism (the red window representing hope and danger), realism, naturalism, and drama are the most prominent and defining genres for this particular piece.

Брак по расчёту,1884,Chekhov,prose,"The best fitting genres for the text are: **realism, satire**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on everyday characters and situations. The characters are ordinary people with relatable concerns like money and social standing. The dialogue is colloquial and the descriptions are grounded in the mundane details of a wedding and its aftermath. 
* **Satire:** The story uses humor and exaggeration to critique societal norms and behaviors. The obsession with money and social status, the shallowness of the characters, and the absurd situation with the featherbed all point to a satirical intent. 

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Romanticism:** The story lacks the idealism, emotional intensity, and focus on nature that characterize romanticism.
* **Symbolism:** There are no overt symbols or attempts to convey deeper meanings beyond the literal events of the story.
* **Modernism:** The story's style and themes are not aligned with the experimentation and fragmentation of modernism.
* **Gothic:** The story lacks the elements of horror, the supernatural, and the grotesque that define the gothic genre.
* **Romance:** While the story involves a marriage, it does not center on a passionate love story.
* **Drama:** The story is written in prose and focuses on narration rather than dialogue and stage directions, making it less suitable for drama.
* **Mystery:** There is no crime or puzzle to be solved in the story.
* **Naturalism:** While the story has elements of social realism, it does not delve into the deterministic and scientific views of human behavior typical of naturalism.

В потёмках,1886,Chekhov,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, satire, drama**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on everyday life and portrays characters and situations in a believable, relatable way. The concerns about theft, the dynamics between husband and wife, and the social hierarchy depicted (including the mistress/servant relationship) are all grounded in realistic details.
* **Satire:** Chekhov uses humor to critique societal norms and human behavior. The absurdity of the situation, the over-the-top reactions of the wife, and the casual acceptance of the fireman's visits by the husband all serve to satirize aspects of middle-class morality and social hypocrisy. 
* **Drama:** The story is driven by conflict and heightened emotions. The fear of the ""thief,"" the tension between the husband and wife, and the implied drama of the fireman's presence all create a dramatic arc, even within a humorous framework.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Romanticism:**  The story lacks the idealization of characters or the emphasis on emotionality and subjectivity typical of Romanticism.
* **Symbolism:** While some might interpret symbolic meanings, the story doesn't heavily rely on symbols to convey its message.
* **Modernism:** The narrative style and themes don't align with the experimentation and fragmentation often found in Modernist literature.
* **Gothic:**  The story lacks the elements of the supernatural, macabre, or eerie atmosphere associated with Gothic literature.
* **Romance:** There's no central love story or focus on romantic love in the narrative.
* **Mystery:** While there's initial suspense about the ""thief,"" the focus shifts to the comedic misunderstanding rather than solving a mystery.
* **Naturalism:** Naturalism often presents characters as being at the mercy of larger social forces, whereas this story focuses more on individual choices and interactions.

Ведьма,1886,Chekhov,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, satire, drama, naturalism**.

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on the everyday life of ordinary people (a sexton and his wife) and their struggles. The details about their living conditions, their poverty, and their interactions feel authentic and relatable.
* **Satire:** The story subtly mocks religious superstition and the pettiness of village life. Saveliy's unfounded accusations of witchcraft and his jealousy over imagined rivals are presented in a way that highlights the absurdity of his beliefs.
* **Drama:** The story revolves around a conflict between Saveliy and Raisa, driven by suspicion, desire, and resentment. The dialogue and actions create tension and build towards a dramatic confrontation. 
* **Naturalism:** The story emphasizes the influence of the harsh natural environment (the blizzard) on the characters' actions and moods.  Their lives are depicted as being somewhat determined by external forces beyond their control.

Вишнёвый сад,1904,Chekhov,prose,"The text provided is a play by Anton Chekhov, so the genres are: **realism, symbolism, modernism, drama, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The play depicts everyday life in pre-revolutionary Russia, focusing on the lives and relationships of ordinary people.
* **Symbolism:** The cherry orchard serves as a powerful symbol of the past, beauty, and the changing social order.
* **Modernism:** Chekhov's play explores themes of alienation, social change, and the human condition, characteristic of modernist literature.
* **Drama:** The text is written in the form of a play, designed for theatrical performance.
* **Naturalism:** The play portrays characters as being subject to external forces and their own inherent flaws, reflecting naturalist principles. 

While the play contains elements of satire and romance, these are not its defining genres. There are no gothic or mystery elements in the text.

Водевиль,1884,Chekhov,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, satire, drama**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on everyday life and characters, particularly the anxieties and social pressures of a middle-class man. The dialogue and concerns of the characters are relatable and reflective of the time period.
* **Satire:** The story subtly mocks the social dynamics and anxieties of the characters. The guests' hypocritical reactions to the play, their fear of authority, and their eagerness to censor any potential offense expose the absurdity of their social interactions.
* **Drama:** The core of the story revolves around a dramatic situation: the creation and reception of a play. The tension builds as the guests dissect and criticize Klochkov's work, culminating in his decision to destroy it.

While elements of other genres might be present in subtle ways, these three are the most prominent and defining aspects of Chekhov's story.

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story depicts everyday life (eating in a restaurant) and focuses on relatable details (observing people, internal thoughts). 
* **Satire:** The story uses humor and exaggeration to poke fun at the cultural differences between the French and the Russians. The French character, Pуркуа, is presented as naive and out-of-touch, leading to absurd assumptions about Russian eating habits. This highlights stereotypes and cultural misunderstandings in a humorous way.

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Romanticism:**  There's no emphasis on strong emotions, individualism, or the glorification of nature.
* **Symbolism:**  The story relies on literal events, not symbolic representations.
* **Modernism:** While there's internal monologue, the story lacks typical modernist themes like fragmentation, alienation, or experimentation with narrative structure.
* **Gothic:** The story has no elements of horror, the supernatural, or a bleak atmosphere. 
* **Romance:**  The focus is not on a love story.
* **Drama:** While there's tension, it's comedic and doesn't build to a dramatic climax.
* **Mystery:** There's no puzzle or crime to be solved.

Грешник из Толедо,1881,Chekhov,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, satire, gothic**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story explores the societal realities of superstition and religious extremism in a historical context. It depicts the human cost of these beliefs and the individual struggles of characters caught within them.
* **Satire:** The story uses irony and exaggeration to criticize the absurdity of the witch hunt, the hypocrisy of the Church, and the blind faith of the Spanish people. This is particularly evident in the portrayal of the bishop and his reasoning for burning women with black hair.
* **Gothic:**  The elements of mystery, suspense, and psychological torment contribute to a gothic atmosphere. Maria's imprisonment on the ship, the sinister figure of the monk, and the eventual poisoning all contribute to a dark and unsettling tone.

While elements of **romance** are present in the initial portrayal of Maria and Spalanzo's love, it is quickly overshadowed by the darker themes of the story. The story does not heavily feature elements of **symbolism, modernism, naturalism, drama**, or **mystery**.

Дачники,1885,Chekhov,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, satire, naturalism**. Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story depicts everyday life and relationships (a newly married couple, family visits, anxieties about hosting) with relatable characters and situations.
* **Satire:**  The story subtly mocks the romantic ideals of the couple, juxtaposing their initial happiness with the intrusion of family and the reality of hosting. The moon's ""jealousy"" adds a humorous, satirical layer. 
* **Naturalism:** The story emphasizes the influence of external forces on the characters' lives. Their initial happiness is disrupted by the arrival of relatives, a force they have little control over. 

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Romanticism:** While the initial scene has a romantic sentiment, the story quickly shifts to a more cynical and realistic tone.
* **Symbolism:** There's some light symbolism (e.g., the moon), but it's not the primary focus of the story.
* **Modernism:** Modernism often features fragmentation, stream-of-consciousness, and a break from traditional storytelling, which are not present here.
* **Gothic:** The story lacks the elements of horror, supernatural, or macabre associated with Gothic literature.
* **Romance:** While the story features a married couple, the focus is not on romantic love but on the reality of their lives and relationships.
* **Drama:** Although there's a dramatic shift in mood, the story lacks the intense conflict or heightened emotions typically found in drama.
* **Mystery:** There's no mystery or suspense element in the plot.

Добрый знакомый,1882,Chekhov,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, satire, drama**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on everyday life and social dynamics. The characters, their concerns, and the setting are presented in a way that aims to reflect reality. 
* **Satire:** The story uses humor and irony to criticize societal issues. The protagonist's humiliation, the gossipy nature of Spevsip, and the scrutiny of the girl's parents are all presented in a satirical manner to expose the hypocrisy and absurdity of the situation.
* **Drama:** The story revolves around a conflict and heightened emotions. The protagonist's internal struggle, his embarrassment, and his yearning for the girl create a dramatic tension.

While elements of romance might be present (the protagonist's attraction to the girl), it is not the primary focus and is quickly overshadowed by the satirical and dramatic elements of the story. The other genres (symbolism, modernism, gothic, mystery, naturalism) are not evident in the excerpt.

Дополнительные вопросы,1882,Chekhov,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **satire, naturalism** 

Here's why:

* **Satire:** The text uses humor and irony to critique the intrusive and often pointless nature of bureaucratic questionnaires. The questions are absurd and overly personal, mocking the idea of capturing a person's essence through such a format. 
* **Naturalism:**  The focus on detailed, personal questions about weight, habits, and even thoughts reflects a naturalistic interest in the concrete and often mundane details of an individual's life. This aligns with naturalism's aim to depict reality in a detached, objective manner.

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Realism:** While the text deals with everyday life, its exaggerated and humorous tone pushes it beyond a purely realistic depiction.
* **Romanticism:**  Romanticism emphasizes emotion, individualism, and the sublime, which are absent from this satirical piece. 
* **Symbolism:**  There is no apparent use of symbols to convey deeper meanings.
* **Modernism:** Modernism often explores themes of alienation and fragmentation, which are not the focus here.
* **Gothic:** Gothic literature relies on elements of horror, the supernatural, and decay, which are not present in the text.
* **Romance:**  The text lacks the focus on love and relationships that defines the romance genre.
* **Drama:** While the questions could lead to dramatic situations, the text itself is not structured as a dramatic work.
* **Mystery:** There is no crime or puzzle to be solved.

Дуэль,1891,Chekhov,prose,"The word ""Дуэль"" is Russian for ""duel"".  This alone doesn't give us enough information to pinpoint specific genres.  Here's why:

* **A duel could be a key plot element in many genres:**  Realism, romanticism, drama, and even gothic literature could all feature duels. 
* **We need more context:**  Is ""Дуэль"" the title of a book? A play? A movie? Knowing the type of work would help. 
* **Even a title isn't everything:** The tone, writing style, and themes of the work determine the genre, not just the presence of a duel.

Каштанка,1887,Chekhov,prose,"The genres that best describe ""Каштанка"" are: **realism, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on the everyday experiences of an ordinary dog.  It portrays her struggles, confusion, and joys in a believable way, without romanticizing or idealizing her situation. The characters, including the humans, are presented as flawed and relatable. 
* **Naturalism:** The story highlights the impact of social and environmental forces on Kashanka's life. She is at the mercy of the humans around her and their decisions, and her fate is shaped by these external factors. Her instincts and basic needs for survival are emphasized. 

While the story has elements of other genres:

* **Drama:** There's inherent drama in Kashanka getting lost and her experiences with the new owner.
* **Satire:** The portrayal of the struggling artist and his trained animals could be seen as slightly satirical.

The core of the story centers around realism and naturalism, making them the most fitting classifications.

Толстый и тонкий,1883,Chekhov,prose,"The best fitting genres for the provided text are: **realism, satire, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on everyday life and social interactions, depicting characters and situations with a focus on verisimilitude.  The emphasis on details like the smell of food and the awkward social dynamics makes it realistic. 
* **Satire:**  The story clearly mocks social climbing and the obsession with rank and status. The exaggerated reactions of the thin man and his family to the fat man's high position are meant to be humorous and critical of such behavior.
* **Naturalism:** This genre is a subset of realism, emphasizing the impact of social conditions and environment on individuals. The thin man's subservient behavior can be seen as a product of his social standing and his desire for advancement, highlighting how social forces shape individual choices.

Let's consider why the other options are less fitting:

* **Romanticism:** This genre celebrates emotion, individuality, and idealism. The story focuses on societal constraints and satirical observation, not romantic ideals.
* **Symbolism:** While there might be subtle symbolic elements, the story's focus is not on elaborate symbolism or hidden meanings.
* **Modernism:** While some aspects of satire and social critique are present in Modernism, the story lacks the experimental style, fragmentation, or psychological depth often associated with this genre.
* **Gothic:** This genre is characterized by elements of horror, mystery, and the supernatural, which are absent in this story.
* **Romance:**  This genre focuses on love and relationships. While family is present, the story's focus is not romantic love.
* **Drama:** Although there's an element of drama in the social interaction, the story's primary mode is not dramatic in the sense of a play.
* **Mystery:**  There's no mystery or suspense element in the narrative.

Долг прежде всего,1851,Herzen,prose,"The text you provided exhibits characteristics of **realism, satire, and drama**. Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text focuses on detailed descriptions of everyday life, societal structures, and the psychological complexities of the characters. The portrayal of Lev Stepanovich's cruel treatment of his dependents, the dynamics within the Stolygin family, and the social commentary on serfdom all point towards realism.

* **Satire:** The text uses humor and irony to critique various aspects of Russian society, particularly the aristocracy and the institution of serfdom. Lev Stepanovich's absurd behavior, the portrayal of the ineffective education system, and the manipulation of Mikhail Stepanovich by various individuals are examples of satirical elements.

* **Drama:** The text features intense conflicts, emotional turmoil, and a series of significant events that unfold throughout the narrative. The struggles of Marya Valerianovna, the moral dilemma faced by Anatol, and the power dynamics within the Stolygin household create a strong sense of drama. 
"
Елена,1838,Herzen,prose,"**Realism, Romanticism, Drama** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on detailed portrayals of everyday life in Moscow, including social customs, class distinctions, and the routines of characters like Ivan Sergeevich. The text delves into the psychological complexities of the characters, exploring their inner thoughts and motivations.
* **Romanticism:**  The passionate love affair between the Prince and Elena, the Prince's dramatic emotional outbursts, his idealized view of Potemkin, and his pursuit of glory and power all align with Romantic themes. The emphasis on emotion, individualism, and the power of nature (e.g., the storm scene) further solidify this categorization.
* **Drama:** The story features a strong narrative structure with a clear conflict (the Prince's love triangle and his descent into madness), rising action, climax, and resolution. The dialogue-heavy scenes, particularly the confessions and arguments between the characters, create a sense of dramatic tension and theatrical presentation.

Let's address why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Symbolism:** While there might be some symbolic elements (like the recurring imagery of the storm),  symbolism is not a primary focus or driving force in the narrative.
* **Modernism:**  The text predates Modernism, lacking its characteristic fragmentation, non-linearity, and self-consciousness.
* **Gothic:** The story lacks the sinister atmosphere, supernatural elements, and focus on the grotesque that define the Gothic genre. 
* **Satire:**  Though there are glimpses of social commentary, particularly on the shallowness of Moscow society,  satire is not the story's primary mode.
* **Romance:**  While the story includes a romance plot, the broader themes of guilt, redemption, and social realism make ""romance"" too narrow a categorization. 
* **Mystery:** The text does not center around a puzzle or crime to be solved.
* **Naturalism:**  Naturalism, with its focus on social determinism and detached observation, is not as prominent as the psychological and emotional realism present in the text. 
"
Кто виноват,1846,Herzen,prose,"The text you provided is best described by the following genres: **realism, satire, romance, drama**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on portraying everyday life, particularly the social dynamics of various classes in Russian society.  The detailed descriptions of homes, daily routines, and concerns about money and social status contribute to this.
* **Satire:** The text uses humor and irony to critique the hypocrisy and superficiality of provincial life, particularly amongst the wealthy landowners and lower-level bureaucrats.  The characters of General Negrow, the various councilors, and the teachers are often presented with satirical intent. 
* **Romance:** The love triangle between Kruciferskaya, Beltov, and Krucifersky is a central plot element, featuring passionate emotions, secret rendezvous, and internal conflicts.
* **Drama:** The story explores intense emotional experiences of love, loss, jealousy, and moral dilemmas, leading to high-stakes situations and internal struggles for the characters.

While there are elements of social commentary which could be associated with naturalism, the focus on individual characters and their emotional experiences makes realism a stronger fit.  The text doesn't use symbolism in a way that is typical of the Symbolist movement, nor does it experiment with form and structure in a way that aligns with modernism.  Gothic and mystery elements are not present in this story. 
"
Легенда,1836,Herzen,prose,"**Romanticism, Drama** 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The text emphasizes strong emotions, idealism, and the power of nature. The story centers on passionate love, religious fervor, and the yearning for a higher purpose. The descriptions of Alexandria and the natural world are infused with emotion and beauty, characteristic of Romantic literature.
* **Drama:** The narrative is driven by a compelling plot with intense conflicts and heightened emotional situations. The characters face difficult choices, experience profound transformations, and suffer tragic consequences. The dialogue, particularly the speeches of the Abbot and Feodor, has a dramatic quality.

While the story has elements of other genres, these two are most prominent:

* **Realism:** The story does touch upon social issues and realistic details like poverty and social ostracization, but the overarching focus leans towards romanticized ideals and dramatic situations.
* **Other genres:** Symbolism, modernism, gothic, satire, mystery, and naturalism are not as evident in the core themes and style of the story. 
"
Мимоездом,1846,Herzen,prose,"realism, satire, drama 
"
С того берега,1851,Herzen,prose,"The text you provided is best described by the following genres: **realism, romanticism, satire**.

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text engages with contemporary social and political issues of the time (mid-19th century Europe), offering sharp commentary on the failures of the 1848 revolutions and the rise of reactionism. The detailed descriptions of Paris during and after the June Days, the cynicism towards political figures, and the discussion of the plight of the working class all point towards a realist approach.
* **Romanticism:** Despite the disillusionment, the text expresses strong emotions, idealism, and yearning for a better future. The passionate defense of individual freedom, the criticism of societal hypocrisy, and the search for meaning in a tumultuous world are hallmarks of Romantic thought. The text also romanticizes figures like Rousseau and Byron, emphasizing their struggles and idealism.
* **Satire:** The text employs biting wit, irony, and sarcasm to criticize various political factions, social hypocrisy, and the failings of human nature. The mocking tone towards the bourgeoisie, the comparisons of political figures to clowns and villains, and the sarcastic use of religious language for political commentary all contribute to the satirical nature of the piece.

While the text touches upon themes of death, destruction, and societal decay, it doesn't fully embrace the characteristics of **gothic** or **naturalism**.  **Symbolism** is also not a dominant element, though some metaphorical language is used. There are elements of **drama** in the conversational format and the portrayal of conflict, but it's not a play. Finally, there's no central **mystery** driving the text.

"
Сорока-воровка,1848,Herzen,prose,"**Realism, Satire, Drama** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on social issues and depicts characters with relatable flaws and struggles.  The critiques of societal norms and the power dynamics between the wealthy and the artists are grounded in realistic observations.
* **Satire:** The narrative satirizes the hypocrisy of the wealthy patron, the strict social constraints placed upon women, and the superficiality of some who appreciate art.  The ironic tone and exaggerated situations highlight these flaws.
* **Drama:** The core of the story revolves around a dramatic plot with intense emotions, a tragic heroine, and a conflict rooted in societal injustices. The theatrical setting and the discussion about acting reinforce the dramatic nature of the narrative.

**Why the other genres are less fitting:**

* **Romanticism:** While there are elements of passion and idealized artistic talent, the focus on social critique and the story's pessimistic tone move it away from pure romanticism.
* **Symbolism:** The story uses symbolism, but it's not the driving force of the narrative.
* **Modernism:** Modernist themes of alienation and fragmentation aren't central to the story.
* **Gothic:** There are no elements of the supernatural, horror, or the macabre.
* **Romance:** While there's a romantic subplot, it's overshadowed by the broader social critique and the tragic fate of the actress.
* **Mystery:**  The story doesn't center around a puzzle or crime to be solved. 
* **Naturalism:** Naturalism focuses on determinism and social forces shaping individuals, but this story allows for more agency and choice. 
"
Трагедия за стаканом грога,1864,Herzen,prose,"The best fitting genres for the text are: **realism, naturalism, satire**.

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on depicting everyday life and the struggles of ordinary people. The detailed description of the setting, the characters' social positions, and their reactions to their circumstances are all elements of realism.
* **Naturalism:**  The story emphasizes the impact of social and economic forces on the individual's life. The waiter's downfall due to bankruptcy and his inability to find work despite his efforts highlights the deterministic aspects of naturalism. 
* **Satire:** While not the dominant element, there's a subtle satirical undercurrent in the portrayal of English society, particularly the class differences and the hypocrisy surrounding the waiter's situation. The comparison with fallen historical figures further adds a satirical touch.

Let's look at why the other genres are less suitable:

* **Romanticism:** This genre emphasizes emotion, individualism, and the glorification of the past, which are not central themes in this story.
* **Symbolism:** The story employs some imagery (e.g., the storm in a teacup metaphor), but it doesn't rely heavily on symbolism to convey its message.
* **Modernism:**  While the text explores themes of social upheaval and disillusionment, it lacks the experimentation in form and style typical of modernism.
* **Gothic:** This genre relies on elements of horror, the supernatural, and decay, which are absent in this story. 
* **Romance:** The story focuses on social issues and personal hardship, not romantic love.
* **Drama:** While the story has dramatic elements, it's written as a narrative rather than a play.
* **Mystery:**  The story revolves around a social situation and character study, not a puzzle to be solved.

"
Вий,1835,Gogol,prose,"The text provided is a chapter from Nikolai Gogol's story ""Viy"". The genres that best describe this text are: 

**Gothic, Satire, Mystery, Naturalism**

Here's why:

* **Gothic:**  The story features prominent gothic elements such as a haunting, supernatural beings (the witch and Viy), a creepy old church, death, and a focus on the grotesque (Viy's appearance).
* **Satire:** Gogol satirizes the seminary students, highlighting their gluttony, poverty, petty rivalries, and tendency towards violence and theft.  He uses humor to depict the students and their escapades, even when dealing with fear and the supernatural.

* **Gothic:** The story doesn't feature the supernatural or macabre elements typical of gothic literature.

"
Мёртвые души,1842,Gogol,prose,"The genres that best describe ""Dead Souls"" by Nikolai Gogol are: **realism, satire, drama**.

"
Портрет,1833,Gogol,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, romanticism, gothic, satire, mystery**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story includes detailed descriptions of everyday life in St. Petersburg, particularly in the less glamorous Kolomna district. It portrays the struggles of artists, the dynamics between social classes, and the allure of wealth and status.
* **Romanticism:** The text emphasizes the power of art, the artist's emotional journey, and the sublime beauty of nature and spirituality. The protagonist's talent is presented as a divine gift, and his descent into obsession is depicted with dramatic flair.
* **Gothic:**  The story features a mysterious and unsettling portrait with piercing eyes that seem to possess supernatural qualities. The portrait's influence on the protagonist and others creates a sense of dread and foreboding. The roстовщик's unsettling appearance and the eerie atmosphere of his house contribute to this gothic tone.
* **Satire:** Gogol subtly criticizes the superficiality of the art world, the fickleness of patrons, and the hypocrisy of those who prioritize wealth and social climbing over artistic integrity. 
* **Mystery:** The story revolves around the enigmatic portrait and its strange history. The unexplained events surrounding the roстовщик and the curse associated with the portrait create a compelling mystery that drives the plot.

Тарас Бульба,1835,Gogol,prose,"The genres that best describe the excerpt from ""Taras Bulba"" are: **romanticism, drama, realism**. 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:**  The text emphasizes strong emotions, individualism (Taras and his sons), heroism, and a glorification of the Cossack way of life and their connection to nature (particularly the steppe). The passionate love story of Andriy also fits the romantic mold.
* **Drama:** The excerpt is filled with conflict (internal and external), heightened emotional situations, and strong actions with significant consequences (death, betrayal).
* **Realism:** While romanticized, the text also depicts the harsh realities of war and Cossack society. It touches on social issues, political conflicts, religious intolerance, and the brutality of the era.

* **Drama:** The story has heightened emotional stakes, conflicts (Aşık-Kerib's poverty, Kurşud-bek's pursuit of Magul-Megeri), and a climactic resolution.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **Realism:**  The story relies heavily on fantastical elements like divine intervention (Hızır/ St. George) and incredible journeys, making it diverge from realistic depiction.
* **Symbolism:** While there could be some symbolic interpretations, the story doesn't primarily function through a complex network of symbols. 
* **Modernism:** The story lacks the self-consciousness, fragmentation, and focus on subjective experience characteristic of modernism.

* **Satire:** Lermontov criticizes the superficiality and hypocrisy of high society, both in St. Petersburg and in the provincial ""water society"" of the spa town.
* **Romance:** The story centers on love affairs, particularly Pechorin's pursuit of Bela and Princess Mary, with elements of intrigue and dramatic encounters.
* **Drama:** The narrative is driven by conflict, heightened emotions, and significant events like duels and abductions, creating a sense of dramatic tension.

While the story contains some elements of mystery (like the initial ambiguity surrounding the blind boy and the girl), it's not the primary focus. The other genres listed (symbolism, modernism, gothic, and naturalism) are not strongly represented in this excerpt. 
"
Штосс,1845,Lermontov,prose,"The text provided exemplifies the following genres: **romanticism, gothic, mystery, drama**.

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The text focuses on intense emotions, the supernatural, and the power of the individual imagination.  The portrayal of Lugin's obsessive pursuit of the mysterious woman, his internal struggles, and the idealized depiction of the woman all point to romantic themes. 
* **Gothic:** The story features elements of mystery, the supernatural, a dark and gloomy setting (St. Petersburg in November), psychological torment, and a sense of impending doom, all characteristic of Gothic literature.
* **Mystery:** The story centers around a mysterious figure (the old man), a strange apartment,  and unexplained events that Lugin tries to unravel, creating suspense and intrigue.
* **Drama:**  The text presents a dramatic conflict between Lugin and the mysterious gambler, heightened by the presence of the ethereal woman and Lugin's increasingly desperate situation. 

While elements of realism are present, the story's overall tone and emphasis on the supernatural and psychological aspects make it less of a purely realistic piece. Symbolism is present, especially with the enigmatic woman, but it's not the driving force behind the narrative. Modernism is not a fitting genre as the text lacks the characteristic stylistic experimentation and themes of alienation common to that period. Satire is also not present as the text takes its subject matter seriously, aiming for dramatic tension and psychological depth rather than mockery. Finally, while there's a romantic element between Lugin and the ethereal woman, ""romance"" as a primary genre doesn't fully encompass the story's scope and focus. 
"
Бывшие люди,1897,Gorky,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, naturalism, satire, drama**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text provides a detailed and gritty portrayal of the lives of impoverished and marginalized individuals. It focuses on their daily struggles, their vices, and their bleak outlook on life. The characters are complex and flawed, reflecting the realities of poverty and social exclusion.
* **Naturalism:** This genre is closely related to realism and emphasizes the deterministic forces that shape human lives. The characters in the text are shown to be products of their environment, trapped in a cycle of poverty and despair from which there seems to be no escape.
* **Satire:**  While the text portrays the plight of the characters with empathy, there's also a satirical edge to the portrayal of the wealthy merchant, Petunnikov, and his interactions with the impoverished. The humor is dark and ironic, highlighting the absurdity and injustice of the social order.
* **Drama:** The text is full of dramatic tension and conflict. The interactions between the characters, particularly between Kuvalda and Petunnikov, are charged with hostility and resentment. The death of the teacher adds a further layer of drama and tragedy to the story. 

While elements of other genres might be present, the four listed above are the most dominant and defining characteristics of the text. 
"
В людях,1915,Gorky,prose,"The word ""В людях"" is Russian for ""Among People"".  It's impossible to determine genre from just a title. We need more context!  

Here's why:

* **""В людях"" could be the title of many things:** A novel, a play, a poem, a song, a film, etc.
* **Genre is determined by content and style:**  We need to know what the story is about, how it's written, and its themes to identify the genre. 

**Can you provide more information?** For example:

* **What is ""В людях""?** (A book, a movie, etc.)
* **What is it about?** (Brief plot summary)
* **Who wrote/created it?** (Knowing the creator can sometimes give genre clues.)

"
Город жёлтого дьявола,1906,Gorky,prose,"The text provided is best described by these genres: **realism, symbolism, naturalism**. Here's why:

* **Realism:** Gorky provides a detailed and graphic depiction of New York City, focusing on the harsh realities of poverty, industrialization, and the dehumanizing effects of capitalism. The descriptions of the slums, the workers, and the pervasive grime are all grounded in a realistic portrayal of urban life in the early 20th century.
* **Symbolism:**  Gorky uses heavy symbolism throughout the text. The ""Yellow Devil"" (Gold), the city as a monstrous ""stomach,"" the ""bronze people"" representing forgotten heroes, and the pervasive fire motif all work on a symbolic level to critique societal issues and the human condition.
* **Naturalism:** The text aligns with Naturalism's focus on the deterministic forces shaping human lives. The characters are presented as victims of their environment, trapped by poverty and the relentless machinery of the city. Gorky emphasizes the brutal and unforgiving nature of the city and its impact on the people who live there.

While the text has elements of **satire** (the critique of capitalism and the absurdity of the ""rat race""), **modernism** (the fragmented, stream-of-consciousness style in some passages), and even **gothic** (the dark, grotesque descriptions of the city), these are not the primary driving forces behind the text. 

**Romanticism, romance, drama, and mystery** are not applicable genres to this excerpt. 
"
Двадцать шесть и одна,1899,Gorky,prose,"The text you provided exhibits elements of **realism, naturalism, drama**. Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on the harsh realities of working-class life, depicting the characters' poverty, difficult working conditions, and lack of agency.
* **Naturalism:** The text emphasizes how social and environmental factors determine the characters' actions and fates. The characters are trapped by their circumstances, and their lives are shaped by forces beyond their control.
* **Drama:** The story presents a conflict between the workers and their environment, as well as the internal conflict within the characters. The interaction between the workers and Tanya creates a dramatic arc with rising tension and a culminating climax.

While the story has elements of romance (the workers' infatuation with Tanya), it ultimately subverts romantic tropes, showcasing the bleak reality of their situation. It doesn't delve into symbolism, modernism, gothic, satire, or mystery in a significant way.

"
Детство,1914,Gorky,prose,"The word ""Детство"" is Russian for ""Childhood"".  Based on that, here are the applicable genres:

**Realism, Drama** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Stories about childhood often focus on realistic depictions of experiences, relationships, and growth.
* **Drama:** Childhood is full of emotional highs and lows, making it inherently dramatic. 

Let's consider why the others are less likely:

* **Romanticism:** While childhood can be idealized, ""детство"" alone doesn't suggest a focus on the Romantic era's emphasis on emotion and individualism.
* **Symbolism:**  We need more context to assume a heavy use of symbols.
* **Modernism:**  Modernism often deals with alienation and societal critique, which may or may not be central to a story about childhood.
* **Gothic:**  Gothic literature relies on elements of horror, mystery, and the supernatural, not typically associated with general childhood narratives.
* **Satire:** Satire uses humor to critique, which isn't implied by the word ""childhood"" itself.
* **Romance:** While first loves can occur in childhood, ""детство"" is too broad to assume a focus on romantic love.
* **Mystery:**  There's no inherent mystery suggested by the word ""childhood"" alone.
* **Naturalism:** Naturalism emphasizes the impact of social and environmental forces on individuals. While relevant to childhood, ""детство"" alone doesn't make it the primary focus.

"
Ледоход,1912,Gorky,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, naturalism, drama**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on the everyday lives of working-class people (carpenters, laborers) and their struggles. The detailed descriptions of their work, language, and interactions contribute to a realistic portrayal of their world.
* **Naturalism:**  The story highlights the power of nature (the ice drift) and how it impacts the lives of the characters, who are often depicted as being at its mercy. The focus on the characters' baser instincts (theft, deception, survival) aligns with naturalism's emphasis on determinism and the influence of environment. 
* **Drama:** The story contains elements of conflict and tension, particularly surrounding the ice drift and the characters' varying reactions to it. The dialogue and interactions between the characters, especially Osip's deception and subsequent exposure, contribute to the dramatic nature of the narrative.

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Romanticism:** The story lacks the idealism, focus on emotions, and glorification of nature typical of romanticism. 
* **Symbolism:** While the ice drift could be interpreted symbolically, the story primarily focuses on the literal event and its consequences. There isn't a pervasive use of symbols to convey deeper meanings.
* **Modernism:** The story predates the modernist movement, which is characterized by experimentation with form and a focus on psychological complexity.
* **Gothic:** The story doesn't feature the elements of horror, supernatural, or decay characteristic of gothic literature.
* **Satire:** While there's some irony and critique of human behavior (Osip's actions), the story's primary focus isn't on satirizing society or individuals.
* **Romance:** The story doesn't center around a love story or romantic relationships.
* **Mystery:** There's no central mystery or investigation in the story. 
"
Ма-аленькая!...,1895,Gorky,prose,"realism, drama, naturalism 
"
Макар Чудра,1892,Gorky,prose,"The best genres to describe the text are: **realism, romanticism, symbolism, romance, drama**. Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story depicts the lives and struggles of Romani people, offering a glimpse into their nomadic lifestyle, beliefs, and values. The characters face real-life dilemmas and consequences. 
* **Romanticism:**  The story is filled with strong emotions, passionate characters, and emphasizes individualism and freedom. The love story of Loiko and Radda is dramatic and tragic, highlighting the power of love and the clash between personal desires and societal norms. 
* **Symbolism:** The characters and their actions carry symbolic meanings. Radda represents untamed freedom and pride, while Loiko embodies passionate love and artistic expression. The wide steppe symbolizes boundless freedom, while the sea represents the vastness and unpredictability of life.
* **Romance:**  The core of the story revolves around the passionate and ultimately tragic love story of Loiko and Radda. Their relationship is filled with longing, conflict, and sacrifice.
* **Drama:** The story unfolds with dramatic tension, culminating in a tragic climax. The characters' confrontations, internal struggles, and ultimate fate create a highly dramatic narrative.

Let's address why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Modernism:** While there's emotional depth, the story doesn't exhibit the fragmentation, introspection, and non-linear narratives often found in modernist works.
* **Gothic:** The story lacks the supernatural elements, dark atmosphere, and psychological suspense typical of gothic literature.
* **Satire:**  The story aims to portray the Romani culture and individual characters, not to ridicule or expose societal flaws through humor or irony. 
* **Mystery:** There's no central puzzle or investigation driving the plot.
* **Naturalism:** While depicting the harsh realities of Romani life, the story focuses more on individual characters and their choices than on deterministic forces shaping their destinies. 
"
Мать,1906,Gorky,prose,"The word ""Мать"" is simply the Russian word for ""mother"".  There's no text to analyze, so it's impossible to assign genres. 
"
Мещане,1901,Gorky,prose,"The best fitting genres for the text provided are: **realism, naturalism, drama**.

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The play focuses on portraying everyday life of ordinary people (the Bessemenov family and their lodgers), their struggles, relationships, and disappointments. The dialogue is natural and the characters are flawed and relatable. 
* **Naturalism:** This genre often explores how social and environmental forces shape individuals. The play highlights the restrictive and suffocating environment of the Bessemenov household and how it impacts each character's choices and well-being.  
* **Drama:** The core of the text is a theatrical play, designed to be performed on stage.  It features dialogue, stage directions, and a plot driven by conflict and character development. 

While there are elements of **symbolism** (the old, unchanging cupboard) and **satire** (Perchikhin's quirky character and social commentary), they are not the dominant forces shaping the text. 

The remaining genres (**romanticism, modernism, gothic, romance, mystery**) do not align with the themes, style, or structure of the play. 
"
Мои университеты,1923,Gorky,prose,"The text best fits the genres of **realism** and **naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text focuses on portraying life as it is, without idealization or romanticization. It depicts the struggles of the protagonist, the harsh realities of poverty, and the complex social dynamics of both urban and rural life. 
* **Naturalism:**  The text emphasizes the influence of social and environmental factors on the characters' lives.  The protagonist's choices are often dictated by circumstance, and his journey reflects the deterministic forces at play. The detailed descriptions of poverty, labor, and the protagonist's psychological state contribute to the naturalistic tone.

While there are elements of **romanticism** in the protagonist's yearning for a better life and his initial idealism, the overall tone and focus of the text lean towards a more realistic and naturalistic portrayal of his experiences.

"
Несвоевременные мысли,1918,Gorky,prose,"The best descriptors from your list for Maxim Gorky's ""Untimely Thoughts"" are: **realism, satire, naturalism**. Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text directly addresses the social and political turmoil of Russia in 1917-1918. Gorky provides detailed observations of daily life, the struggles of various social groups, and the psychological effects of war and revolution. His focus on the ""common man"" and their experiences aligns with realist principles.
* **Satire:** Gorky uses irony, sarcasm, and biting wit to criticize various political factions, societal behaviors, and the hypocrisy he sees around him. He mocks the simplistic solutions offered by some, the self-serving actions of politicians, and the brutality of the ""mob mentality."" 
* **Naturalism:** While less prominent than realism and satire, elements of naturalism appear in Gorky's portrayal of the darker aspects of human nature, the influence of social environment on individuals, and the sense of determinism in some of his observations. 

Let's consider why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Romanticism:** Gorky's text is grounded in the realities of his time. While he expresses hope for the future, his writing lacks the idealized characters, escapist settings, or heightened emotion characteristic of romanticism. 
* **Symbolism:** Gorky doesn't rely heavily on symbolic language or imagery to convey his message. His writing is primarily focused on direct commentary and social observation.
* **Modernism:** While Gorky's disillusionment with traditional values echoes some modernist themes, ""Untimely Thoughts"" predates the stylistic experimentation and fragmentation typical of full-fledged modernist literature.
* **Gothic:** The text lacks the supernatural elements, macabre atmosphere, and psychological suspense associated with the gothic genre.
* **Romance:**  The text focuses on social and political issues rather than romantic love or idealized relationships.
* **Drama:**  While Gorky's writing is often dramatic in its tone, ""Untimely Thoughts"" is a collection of essays, not a play designed for theatrical performance.
* **Mystery:** The text doesn't revolve around a central mystery or involve solving a crime. Gorky is concerned with analyzing the social and political landscape.

"
Песня о Буревестнике,1901,Gorky,prose,"Romanticism, Symbolism 
"
Песня о соколе,1899,Gorky,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **romanticism, symbolism, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The text emphasizes emotion, individualism, and the power of nature.  The descriptions of the sea and mountains are highly evocative, and the story of the Falcon and the Snake centers on themes of freedom, idealism, and heroic struggle. 
* **Symbolism:** The Falcon and the Snake are clear symbols, representing different approaches to life – the Falcon embodies striving for ideals and freedom, while the Snake represents a pragmatic and earthbound existence.  The sea and the sky also function symbolically, suggesting vastness, mystery, and the possibility of transcendence.
* **Naturalism:** The story depicts characters who are influenced by their environment, particularly the harsh, beautiful natural world of the Crimean coast. The focus on detail in the descriptions, the emphasis on the power of nature, and the philosophical musings about life and death align with the naturalist style.

While the text contains elements of realism (descriptive detail) and drama (the narrative of the Falcon and the Snake), these are not the primary driving forces of the story.  The other genres (modernism, gothic, satire, romance, mystery) do not fit the text's content or style.

Скуки ради,1897,Gorky,prose,"realism, naturalism, drama 
"
Старуха Изергиль,1895,Gorky,prose,"**Romanticism, Symbolism** 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The text emphasizes strong emotions, individualism, and the power of nature.  The characters are driven by passion and instinct (Larrra's pride, Danko's self-sacrifice), and the natural world plays a significant role (the sea, the storm, the oppressive forest). The stories have a mythical, larger-than-life quality. 
* **Symbolism:**  The characters and events hold symbolic meaning beyond their literal representation.  Larrra embodies the dangers of unchecked pride and isolation. Danko symbolizes self-sacrifice and the potential for individuals to inspire others. The ""burning heart"" is a potent image of passionate devotion.

While the story touches on elements of other genres, these are the most prominent:

* **Realism:** While the stories are fantastical, Izergil's own life story has some realistic elements, particularly her struggles as a woman in a patriarchal society. However, the overall focus on larger themes and symbolic meaning pushes the text beyond pure realism.
* **Naturalism:** The story acknowledges the power of nature, but it doesn't portray humans as solely determined by their environment, a key element of naturalism. 

The other genres are not as relevant:

* **Modernism:** The story lacks the experimentation with form and the focus on alienation that characterize modernism.
* **Gothic, Satire, Romance, Drama, Mystery:** These genres are not central to the story's themes or style. 
"
Страсти-мордасти,1913,Gorky,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are **realism, naturalism, drama**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on depicting the harsh realities of poverty and the lives of marginalized individuals. The characters are not idealized, and their struggles are portrayed authentically.
* **Naturalism:** The story emphasizes the deterministic forces that shape the characters' lives, such as poverty and societal prejudices.  It shows how their environment influences their choices and behaviors.
* **Drama:** The story contains strong elements of conflict and tension, particularly the moral dilemma faced by the narrator. The interaction between the narrator, Lenyka, and his mother creates a dramatic dynamic.

While the story contains elements of other genres, these are not the most prominent:

* **Romanticism:** Though there's a focus on emotions and the characters' inner lives, it lacks the idealism and glorification of nature typical of Romanticism. 
* **Symbolism:** While the ""clean field"" could be seen as a symbol of hope or escape,  symbolism is not a driving force in the narrative.
* **Modernism:** The story lacks the fragmentation, introspection, and experimental style associated with Modernism. 
* **Gothic:** The story lacks the supernatural or macabre elements characteristic of the gothic genre.
* **Satire:**  While the story exposes the hypocrisy of society, its primary focus is not on ridicule or mockery.
* **Romance:** There's no romantic relationship or storyline present in the text.
* **Mystery:** The story does not revolve around a crime or an unsolved puzzle. 
"
Фома Гордеев,1899,Gorky,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, naturalism, drama, satire**.

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The novel depicts life on the Volga River during a specific historical period, portraying the characters and their social environment with a high degree of detail and accuracy. It focuses on the struggles of everyday life, wealth accumulation, social hierarchy, and moral dilemmas faced by ordinary people.
* **Naturalism:** The novel explores the themes of determinism and the influence of social and environmental factors on individual characters.  Foma's struggles with his inherent nature, the forces of wealth and social expectation, and his inability to escape his predetermined path are central to the story. 
* **Drama:** The text is full of dramatic tension, conflict, and emotional outbursts. The dialogues are often intense and confrontational, revealing the characters' inner struggles and motivations. The events, such as Foma's outburst on the steamboat and his subsequent downfall, are highly dramatic.
* **Satire:** The novel uses irony and exaggeration to criticize the hypocrisy and moral decay within the merchant class.  The characters like Yakov Mayakin and the wealthy merchants at Kononov's steamboat celebration are portrayed as greedy, hypocritical, and self-serving, despite their outward piety and respectability.

While elements of other genres may be present, they are not the defining features of the text.

* **Romanticism:** Although there are moments of emotional intensity and idealized visions (like Foma's longing for freedom and meaning), the novel's focus on harsh realities and social determinism aligns more with realism and naturalism.
* **Symbolism:**  While some symbolic elements might be present (like the steamboat representing the power of wealth and the river symbolizing the flow of life), they are not extensively used to convey deeper meaning.
* **Modernism:**  While the novel explores themes of alienation and the search for meaning, it lacks the experimental narrative techniques and fragmented perspectives characteristic of modernism. 
* **Gothic:**  There are no elements of supernatural or macabre typical of the gothic genre.
* **Romance:** While Foma experiences romantic and sexual relationships, the novel's focus is on his broader struggles with life and society, not solely on romantic love.
* **Mystery:**  The text does not revolve around solving a crime or unraveling a secret. 
"

"
Человек,1903,Gorky,prose,"The best fitting genres to describe the text are: **romanticism, symbolism**. 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The text emphasizes individualism, the power of the human spirit, and the pursuit of ideals. It celebrates the human potential for greatness and transcendence, key elements of Romanticism. 
* **Symbolism:** The text uses symbolic figures like ""Man"", ""Thought"", ""Death"", ""Love"" etc. to represent abstract concepts. The language is highly metaphorical and aims to evoke emotions and philosophical ideas rather than provide a realistic portrayal of life.

While elements of other genres might be present, they are not as prominent:

* **Realism:** The text focuses on abstract concepts and idealized human potential rather than a realistic depiction of everyday life.
* **Modernism:**  While the text touches on themes of disillusionment and alienation, it ultimately champions the power of human spirit, unlike the often pessimistic outlook of Modernism.
* **Gothic, Satire, Romance, Drama, Mystery, Naturalism:** These genres are not significantly represented in the themes and style of the text.

"
Альберт,1858,Tolstoy,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, romanticism, symbolism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story depicts the harsh realities of poverty, alcoholism, and social disparity, particularly in the portrayal of Albert's living conditions and struggles. The detailed descriptions of St. Petersburg and the characters' daily lives also contribute to the realistic element.
* **Romanticism:** The emphasis on Albert's intense emotions, his passion for music, and the transformative power of his art are characteristic of Romanticism. The story idealizes Albert's talent and portrays him as a misunderstood genius, a common Romantic trope. 
* **Symbolism:**  The ""glass violin"" that Albert plays in his dream-like state is a strong symbolic element, representing the fragility of his talent and mental state. The recurring phrase ""He is the best and happiest""  takes on a symbolic meaning, contrasting Albert's outward struggles with his inner world.

Let's address why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Modernism:** While there are elements of introspection and psychological depth, the text lacks the stylistic experimentation and fragmentation often found in Modernist literature.
* **Gothic:** The story doesn't feature supernatural elements, macabre settings, or a sense of dread and suspense characteristic of the Gothic genre.
* **Satire:** There isn't a strong element of social critique or mockery that would define satire. 
* **Romance:**  While there's a subtle emotional connection between Delezov and Albert, the story doesn't focus on a romantic relationship or a quest for love. 
* **Drama:** The story uses a narrative format rather than a dramatic structure with dialogues and stage directions. 
* **Mystery:** There's no central puzzle or crime to be solved in the narrative. 
* **Naturalism:** While the story acknowledges the impact of social forces on individuals, it doesn't portray a deterministic view of human life often associated with Naturalism.

"
Божеское и человеческое,1906,Tolstoy,prose,"The phrase ""Божеское и человеческое"" translates to ""The Divine and the Human."" This concept most closely aligns with these genres:

* **Romanticism:** Romanticism often explored the sublime, the ideal, and the contrast between the human condition and higher powers or nature. 
* **Symbolism:** The juxtaposition of ""divine"" and ""human"" could easily lend itself to symbolic interpretations.

Therefore, the best fitting genres are **romanticism, symbolism**. 
"
Война и мир. Том 1,1867,Tolstoy,prose,"The best fitting genres for ""War and Peace"" are: **realism, romance, drama**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Tolstoy aimed to portray life in Russia as accurately as possible, focusing on the complexities of human relationships and the realities of war.
* **Romance:** The novel features several interwoven love stories and explores the themes of love, marriage, and family.
* **Drama:** ""War and Peace"" is full of dramatic events, emotional turmoil, and conflicts between characters.

Война и мир. Том 3,1868,Tolstoy,prose,"The text you provided is an excerpt from Leo Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"". The genres that best describe this excerpt are: 

**realism, satire, drama, naturalism** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Tolstoy is known for his realistic depiction of characters and events. The excerpt focuses on the inner thoughts and motivations of various characters, their flaws, and their struggles, which is a hallmark of realism.
* **Satire:** Tolstoy uses irony and sarcasm to critique the various motivations behind the war, the self-importance of the ruling class, and the futility of war itself. He mocks the ideas of military genius and the supposed rational justifications for war.
* **Drama:** The excerpt includes scenes of intense action, emotional turmoil, and pivotal events like the Battle of Borodino and the burning of Moscow. This creates a dramatic atmosphere and tension.
* **Naturalism:** Tolstoy explores the role of fate and circumstance in shaping the lives of his characters. He argues that historical events are not driven by the will of great men but by a confluence of unpredictable factors, which aligns with the naturalist view of determinism.

While elements of romanticism might be found elsewhere in the novel, this specific excerpt leans more heavily on the genres mentioned above.

Два гусара,1856,Tolstoy,prose,"The text you provided, the beginning of Leo Tolstoy's ""Two Hussars"", best fits these genres: 

**realism, satire, romance** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Tolstoy is known for his realistic portrayals of Russian society. This excerpt shows detailed descriptions of everyday life, social customs, and the characters' inner thoughts and motivations.
* **Satire:**  The narrator's ironic tone and exaggerated portrayal of certain characters (like the ""cavalryman"" who never served in the cavalry) point towards elements of satire, particularly aimed at the superficiality and hypocrisy of some members of the nobility.
* **Romance:** The story clearly features a romantic storyline involving Count Turbin and Anna Fyodorovna, complete with flirtation, passion, and a clandestine encounter. 

While the story touches on themes of drama, the excerpt doesn't focus heavily on dramatic structure or theatrical elements.  The other genres (symbolism, modernism, gothic, mystery, naturalism) are not as strongly represented in this passage. 
"
Декабристы,1860,Tolstoy,prose,"realism, naturalism 
"
Детство,1852,Tolstoy,prose,"The text you provided falls into the following genres: **realism, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on everyday life experiences and details, portraying characters and situations with a high degree of accuracy and authenticity. The descriptions of the characters, their relationships, and even the setting are detailed and relatable, reflecting the social and cultural norms of the time.
* **Naturalism:** This genre is a subset of realism that emphasizes the influence of external factors, such as social conditions and heredity, on individuals and their lives. The story touches upon these themes, particularly through the portrayal of characters like Karl Ivanovich and Natalia Savishna, whose lives are shaped by their social standing and circumstances.

While the text includes elements of **romance** (especially the young narrator's infatuations), **drama** (the death of the mother), and even **satire** (the portrayal of some characters like Mimi and the young prince), these elements are not dominant enough to classify the text primarily within those genres. 

The text lacks the characteristics of **symbolism**, **modernism**, or **gothic** literature.

Записки маркера,1853,Tolstoy,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, naturalism, drama**.

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on depicting everyday life and societal issues without romanticizing or idealizing them. The detailed portrayal of gambling, social hierarchies, and moral decline reflects a realistic approach.
* **Naturalism:** The text emphasizes the deterministic forces that shape the protagonist's life, such as his social environment, his weaknesses, and his addiction to gambling. His downfall feels inevitable, driven by external and internal forces beyond his control.
* **Drama:** The story builds tension through the protagonist's inner conflict, his clashes with others, and the lead-up to his tragic suicide. The heightened emotions and the turning point of the suicide create a dramatic impact.

While the story includes satirical elements, like the portrayal of the opportunistic Pan and the absurd situations surrounding the protagonist's debts, satire isn't the primary focus.

The other genres are less fitting:

* **Romanticism:** The story lacks the idealism, focus on nature, and celebration of emotion typical of romanticism.
* **Symbolism:** There aren't prominent symbols used to convey deeper meanings.
* **Modernism:**  The text predates the stylistic and thematic innovations of modernism.
* **Gothic:** The story lacks the supernatural elements, gloomy atmosphere, and focus on horror associated with the gothic genre.
* **Mystery:** There's no central mystery to solve.
* **Romance:**  While the protagonist mentions lost love, the focus isn't on a romantic relationship.

"
Из записок князя Д. Нехлюдова (Люцерн),1857,Tolstoy,prose,"The text ""From the Notes of Prince D. Nekhlyudov (Lucerne)"" by Leo Tolstoy can be best described by these genres: 

**realism, naturalism, satire** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on everyday details, social dynamics, and believable characters. The detailed description of the hotel, the guests, and the singer's life all point towards a realistic portrayal of society.
* **Naturalism:**  Tolstoy emphasizes the societal forces that influence individuals. The singer's poverty and the indifference of the wealthy are presented as products of social structures. The focus on determinism and social commentary are key aspects of naturalism.
* **Satire:** Tolstoy uses irony and humor to critique the hypocrisy and shallowness of the wealthy guests. He contrasts their supposed sophistication with their callousness and lack of genuine compassion. The exaggerated description of the guests' behavior serves as a satirical element. 

Let's consider why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Romanticism:** While the protagonist is moved by beauty and has introspective moments, the story's focus on social critique and realistic depictions of hardship don't align with romanticism's emphasis on idealism, emotionalism, and the sublime.
* **Symbolism:** The text lacks the extensive use of symbols and suggestive imagery that characterize symbolism.
* **Modernism:**  This story predates the era of modernism. It lacks features like fragmented narratives, stream of consciousness, and a focus on subjective experience.
* **Gothic:** There are no elements of the supernatural, horror, or the macabre that define gothic literature.
* **Romance:** The text focuses on social commentary and lacks a central love story, which is a defining feature of the romance genre.
* **Drama:** While there's emotional tension, the story isn't structured as a play with dialogue and stage directions.
* **Mystery:** The text doesn't involve a crime or puzzle to be solved.

Отец Сергий,1890,Tolstoy,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, drama, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on believable, relatable human experiences and psychological struggles.  Tolstoy delves into the complexities of faith, doubt, pride, and sexuality in a realistic manner. The social circles, military life, and monastic settings are depicted with a degree of detail that grounds the story in a recognizable reality.
* **Drama:** The narrative unfolds through a series of impactful events and internal conflicts.  The protagonist's journey is fraught with intense emotions, moral dilemmas, and pivotal choices that drive the plot forward. The story explores themes of sin, redemption, and the search for meaning, creating a dramatic arc for the character.
* **Naturalism:**  The story highlights the influence of external forces and social pressures on individual lives.  Kasatsky's choices are often shaped by his environment, social expectations, and the weight of societal norms. The text explores the darker aspects of human nature, suggesting that individuals are partly driven by their baser instincts.

**Why other options are less fitting:**

* **Romanticism:** While the story features a strong emotional core and a journey of self-discovery, it lacks the idealized heroes, exotic settings, and emphasis on individuality that characterize Romanticism.
* **Symbolism:** The story uses symbolism sparingly, primarily focusing on realistic depictions of events and psychological states. 
* **Modernism:** The text predates the key characteristics of Modernism, such as fragmentation, non-linear narratives, and a rejection of traditional values. 
* **Gothic:**  The story lacks the elements of the supernatural, horror, and macabre that define the Gothic genre. 
* **Satire:**  While the story critiques societal hypocrisy and the pursuit of empty ambition, it does so with a focus on psychological realism rather than through direct mockery or exaggeration. 
* **Romance:** The romantic elements are largely overshadowed by the focus on religious themes and the protagonist's internal struggles.
* **Mystery:**  While the story presents internal questions about faith and purpose, it doesn't revolve around a central mystery or a crime to be solved. 
"
Отрочество,1854,Tolstoy,prose,"The best fitting genres for the provided text are: **realism, naturalism, romance**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text focuses on portraying everyday life and experiences of the characters, particularly the psychological and emotional development of the protagonist, Nikolenka. It delves into his thoughts, feelings, and relationships with a focus on realistic detail and internal struggles.
* **Naturalism:** The text explores themes of social class and the impact of external forces on the characters' lives. The relationship between Masha and Vasily, for example, highlights the constraints placed upon them by their social positions. Nikolenka's own observations of those around him and his burgeoning awareness of social inequality further emphasize naturalistic elements.
* **Romance:**  While not a traditional love story, the text portrays elements of romantic longing and idealization.  Nikolenka's infatuation with Masha, his admiration for his brother, and his developing friendship with Dmitry all display aspects of romantic yearning for connection and meaning. 

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Symbolism:** While some details could be interpreted symbolically, the text doesn't rely heavily on symbolism to convey its meaning.
* **Modernism:** Modernist literature is characterized by experimentation and a break from traditional narrative structures, which is not evident in this text.
* **Gothic:** The text lacks the elements of horror, supernatural, and macabre associated with Gothic literature.
* **Satire:** The text doesn't aim to ridicule or expose societal flaws through humor or irony. 
* **Drama:** While the text has emotional intensity and character development, it's not written in a dramatic format with dialogue intended for stage performance.
* **Mystery:** The text doesn't revolve around a central mystery or crime that needs to be solved.

Рубка леса,1855,Tolstoy,prose,"The text provided is best described by the following genres: **realism, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on depicting the lives of ordinary soldiers with accuracy and detail. It avoids romanticizing war or the characters, instead presenting a grounded view of their experiences, thoughts, and conversations.
* **Naturalism:** The text emphasizes the influence of external forces on the characters' lives, such as the harsh environment of the Caucasus, the dangers of war, and the rigid social structures of the military. This deterministic perspective aligns with the principles of naturalism.

While the story contains elements of drama and some subtle satire, these are not the primary driving forces of the narrative. The text doesn't exhibit the characteristics of romanticism, symbolism, modernism, gothic, mystery, or romance in any significant way.

Семейное счастье,1859,Tolstoy,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are **realism, romance, drama**. Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on everyday life experiences, particularly the complexities of marriage and changing feelings over time. The characters are relatable, their struggles feel genuine, and the narrative avoids overly dramatic or idealized scenarios. 
* **Romance:** The core of the story is a love relationship, exploring the initial passionate phase, its evolution, and the challenges faced as love matures. 
* **Drama:** The text features emotional conflicts, internal struggles, and pivotal moments of confrontation between the main characters. The reader is drawn into their evolving dynamic and experiences the tension and emotional weight of their journey.

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Symbolism:** While the story might have symbolic elements, like the changing seasons mirroring the couple's relationship, symbolism isn't a dominant feature.
* **Modernism:** Modernism emphasizes experimentation and breaking traditional narrative forms, which isn't prominent in this text.
* **Gothic:** The text lacks the elements of horror, supernatural, and macabre atmosphere that define the gothic genre.
* **Satire:** There's no strong satirical element or use of humor to critique society or individuals. 
* **Mystery:** The story doesn't center around a crime or puzzle to be solved.
* **Naturalism:** While realism and naturalism share similarities, naturalism focuses on deterministic forces shaping characters' lives. This story is more focused on internal choices and emotional evolution.

Хаджи-Мурат,1896,Tolstoy,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, naturalism, drama**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Tolstoy is known for his realistic portrayal of life and characters. The story focuses on depicting the events and characters of the Caucasus War with a focus on accuracy and detail, avoiding romanticized heroism.
* **Naturalism:** The story emphasizes the power of external forces on the characters, particularly the brutal realities of war and the harshness of nature. The death of Avdeev and the struggle of the ""tatarin"" flower exemplify this.
* **Drama:**  The story is driven by conflict, both internal and external. The main plot revolves around  Hadji Murad's defection and its consequences, creating suspense and tension. The personal struggles of characters like Avdeev and Butler also contribute to the dramatic element.

While the text uses **symbolism** (the ""tatarin"" flower as a symbol of resilience) and contains elements of **romance** (Butler's infatuation with Marya Dmitrievna), these are not the primary driving forces of the narrative.  The text lacks the characteristics of **romanticism**, **modernism**, **gothic**, **satire**, and **mystery**. 
"
Хозяин и работник,1895,Tolstoy,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, naturalism, drama**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on the everyday lives of ordinary people (a merchant and his worker) facing a challenging situation (getting lost in a blizzard).  The details about their clothing, thoughts, and conversations are very grounded and relatable.
* **Naturalism:** The story emphasizes the power of nature (the blizzard) over human will. It portrays characters struggling against indifferent and unforgiving natural forces, ultimately leading to tragic consequences. 
* **Drama:** The story has a strong narrative arc with rising tension, a climax (the decision to spend the night in the blizzard), and a resolution (the discovery of their bodies). The dialogue and internal monologues create a dramatic effect.

While some elements of other genres might be present, these three are the most prominent:

* **Romanticism:** While the story appreciates the power of nature, it lacks the idealized view of nature or the emphasis on emotion and individualism that characterizes Romanticism.
* **Symbolism:** There might be some symbolic interpretations (e.g., the blizzard as a symbol of fate), but symbolism isn't a driving force in the narrative.
* **Modernism:** The story predates the typical modernist period and doesn't exhibit the stylistic experimentation, fragmentation, or focus on psychological introspection often found in Modernist literature.
* **Gothic, Satire, Romance, Mystery:** These genres are not applicable to the story's themes or style.

"
Юность,1857,Tolstoy,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are **realism, romanticism, satire**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text focuses on the psychological and social realities of a young man navigating adolescence. It explores themes of self-awareness, social class, family dynamics, and the complexities of friendship and love, all depicted in a detailed, introspective manner characteristic of realism.
* **Romanticism:** The protagonist's strong emotions, idealism, and yearning for love and happiness, alongside the vivid descriptions of nature and its impact on his emotional state, all align with romantic themes. His dreams and fantasies also contribute to this element.
* **Satire:** The text subtly satirizes the social conventions and superficiality of the upper class, particularly through the protagonist's obsession with ""comme il faut"". His naiveté and misguided attempts to appear sophisticated become a source of humor and social commentary.

While elements of **naturalism** could be argued due to the detailed psychological portrayal, the focus on internal struggles and social interactions aligns more closely with realism. The other genres (symbolism, modernism, gothic, drama, mystery) are not significantly present in the text.

"
Вешние воды,1872,Turgenev,prose,"The genres that best describe ""Spring Torrents"" by Ivan Turgenev are: **realism, romanticism, romance**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story features detailed descriptions of everyday life, social settings, and the psychological complexities of its characters. The portrayal of Sanin's internal struggles and the economic concerns of Frau Lenore are rooted in the realities of the time.
* **Romanticism:**  The story explores themes of passionate love, longing, and the pursuit of individual fulfillment. Sanin's impulsive love for Gemma, their stolen moments in the garden, and the dramatic events surrounding their relationship are hallmarks of romantic literature.
* **Romance:** The narrative centers around a love story with heightened emotions, unexpected encounters, and a focus on the relationship between Sanin and Gemma. The inclusion of elements like the duel and the whirlwind further enhance the romantic nature of the plot.

While the story touches on some social commentary and features vivid descriptions of nature, it doesn't fully embrace the tenets of naturalism or symbolism.  Similarly, elements of drama, mystery, and satire are present but not prominent enough to define the text's overall genre. Modernism and gothic are not relevant to the style and context of Turgenev's work. 
"
Дворянское гнездо,1859,Turgenev,prose,"The text ""Дворянское гнездо"" (A Nest of Gentlefolk) by Ivan Turgenev is best described by these genres: 

**realism, romance, drama** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Turgenev is a key figure in Russian realism, and this novel portrays the lives and relationships of the Russian gentry with a focus on social dynamics and psychological complexity.
* **Romance:** The novel features a central love story and explores themes of love, loss, and societal expectations.
* **Drama:** The narrative is driven by conflicts between characters, societal pressures, and internal struggles. 

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Symbolism:** While symbolism exists in the novel, it's not the primary driving force of the narrative.
* **Modernism:** This novel predates the modernist movement. 
* **Gothic:** The novel lacks the elements of the supernatural, suspense, and gloom typically associated with the gothic genre.
* **Satire:** While some satirical elements might be present, it's not the main focus of the work.
* **Mystery:**  The novel does not revolve around a central mystery to be solved.
* **Naturalism:** Though realism and naturalism share some similarities, ""A Nest of Gentlefolk"" focuses more on the inner lives and relationships of its characters than the deterministic forces of nature often found in naturalist works. 
"
Дым,1867,Turgenev,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, satire, romance**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text offers a detailed portrayal of Russian society in the mid-19th century, focusing on social issues, political discussions, and the clash between traditional and modern values. Characters are complex and flawed, representing various societal types.
* **Satire:** Turgenev employs sharp wit and irony to critique the superficiality, intellectual pretenses, and social climbing of the Russian aristocracy and intelligentsia. This is particularly evident in his portrayal of the gatherings at Gubaryov's and the conversations of the young generals.
* **Romance:** The text revolves around a love triangle between Litvinov, Irina, and Tatiana.  It explores themes of love, passion, duty, and the consequences of choices in matters of the heart.

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Symbolism:** While there might be symbolic elements like the ""smoke"" metaphor, the text doesn't heavily rely on symbols to convey its meaning.
* **Modernism:** Modernism emerged later than the period this text depicts. It lacks the experimental style, fragmentation, and focus on subjective experience typical of modernist literature.
* **Gothic:** The text lacks the elements of horror, the supernatural, and dark atmosphere characteristic of the gothic genre.
* **Drama:** While there are dramatic elements in the story, the text is a novel excerpt, not a play.
* **Mystery:** There's no central mystery driving the plot. 
* **Naturalism:**  While realism and naturalism share some similarities, naturalism emphasizes the deterministic forces of nature and society on individuals, often portraying bleak and pessimistic outcomes.  Turgenev's text, while critical, doesn't fully embrace this level of determinism.

Отцы и дети,1862,Turgenev,prose,"The text you provided is an excerpt from ""Fathers and Sons"" by Ivan Turgenev. The genres that best describe this text are: 

**realism, satire, drama, naturalism** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text focuses on portraying everyday life in 19th-century Russia, with detailed descriptions of characters, settings, and social issues.  
* **Satire:** Turgenev uses humor and irony to critique the clash between traditional values and the emerging nihilistic philosophy, embodied by Bazarov. 
* **Drama:**  The text showcases intense conflicts and emotional struggles between characters, particularly between the older and younger generations. The duel scene is a prime example.
* **Naturalism:**  The text highlights the influence of external factors, like social class and environment, on the characters' lives and choices. Bazarov's scientific worldview and his eventual death from infection emphasize this deterministic aspect. 

While elements of **romanticism** might be present in some characters' backstories (like Pavel Petrovich's past love affair), the overall tone and focus of the excerpt lean heavily towards a realistic and critical portrayal of contemporary society.

Стихотворения в прозе,1878,Turgenev,prose,"The genres that best describe the text above are: **realism, romanticism, symbolism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Turgenev's ""Poems in Prose"" often depict everyday life, particularly the lives of Russian peasants and the stark realities of poverty and suffering. Works like ""The Beggar,"" ""Cabbage Soup,"" and ""The Village"" exemplify this focus on social realism.
* **Romanticism:** The text demonstrates a deep connection to nature and an exploration of individual emotions, particularly those of love, loss, and mortality. The poems ""The Sparrow,"" ""The Rose,"" and ""The Thrush"" are filled with evocative imagery and passionate feelings characteristic of Romanticism.
* **Symbolism:** Turgenev frequently uses symbols and allegories to convey deeper meanings.  Pieces like ""The Threshold,"" ""The Sphinx,"" and ""Nature"" employ symbolic figures and scenarios to explore themes of fate, freedom, and the human condition. 

While some elements of other genres might be present, these three are the most prominent and defining characteristics of Turgenev's ""Poems in Prose"".

"
Алтарь победы,1912,Bryusov,prose,"The text you provided best fits the genres: **realism, romance, drama, historical fiction**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story attempts to depict the social and political realities of Late Roman Empire with detail about daily life, societal hierarchies, and political struggles. 
* **Romance:**  It features a strong love story element, particularly with the protagonist's obsession with Hesperia and his complicated feelings for Rhea.
* **Drama:**  The story is full of dramatic events: conspiracies, betrayals, murders, battles, and internal emotional conflict within the protagonist.
* **Historical Fiction:**  The story is set in a specific historical period (Late Roman Empire) and uses real historical figures and events as background for its fictional narrative. 

While the story contains elements of other genres, they are not as dominant:

* **Symbolism:** There's some symbolism present (e.g., the Altar of Victory, Rhea's prophetic visions), but it's not the driving force of the narrative.
* **Modernism:** Though published in the early 20th century, the story's style and themes are more aligned with 19th-century realism than modernist experimentation. 
* **Gothic:**  There are a few potentially gothic elements (e.g., Rhea's intensity, the dark tone of some scenes), but they don't create a truly gothic atmosphere.
* **Satire:**  While the story critiques societal values and individuals, it's not primarily satirical in its purpose.
* **Mystery:** There's some intrigue and unanswered questions, but the story focuses more on the protagonist's journey and choices than solving a central mystery.
* **Naturalism:**  The story emphasizes human choices and agency more than deterministic forces of nature and environment. 
"
Бемоль,1903,Bryusov,prose,"The best descriptors for the genres present in the text are: **realism, symbolism, modernism**. Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on the mundane details of everyday life - a shop assistant's routine, her struggles with a harsh employer, and her inability to connect with people. The setting and characters are depicted in a straightforward manner without idealization.
* **Symbolism:** The paper goods in the shop take on symbolic significance, representing a world of order and meaning for Anna. Her connection to them is deeper than her connection to people, highlighting the alienation and disillusionment characteristic of symbolism. 
* **Modernism:**  The story explores themes of alienation, isolation, and the breakdown of communication.  Anna's internal life and psychological state are given precedence over plot. The story also employs stream-of-consciousness in some passages, another characteristic of modernist writing.

While the story contains elements of other genres, they aren't as dominant:

* **Naturalism:** Although Anna's environment is bleak and she seems trapped in her situation, the story lacks the extreme determinism and focus on social forces typical of Naturalism.
* **Romance:** The story hints at the potential for a romantic relationship with the street harassers, but this remains undeveloped. 
* **Other genres:** Gothic, satire, mystery, drama are not significantly present in the text. 
"
В башне,1903,Bryusov,prose,"The text demonstrates characteristics of the following genres: **symbolism, modernism, gothic, romance, drama, mystery**. 

Here's why:

* **Symbolism:** The story utilizes heavy symbolism, particularly around the dream and its potential to reflect a deeper, hidden reality. The castle, the characters, and events  can be interpreted on a symbolic level, representing different aspects of the protagonist's psyche and the struggle between love and patriotism.
* **Modernism:** The story focuses on the internal thoughts and feelings of the protagonist, questioning the nature of reality and perception. The blurring of the lines between dream and reality is a common modernist theme.
* **Gothic:** The story features gothic elements like a medieval castle, a sense of entrapment and mystery, a dark and brooding atmosphere, and the potential for violence.
* **Romance:**  A central plotline involves a passionate love story between the protagonist and Matilda. The romantic ideal of love is juxtaposed with the harsh realities of war and political conflict.
* **Drama:** The narrative is driven by conflict, both internal (the protagonist's struggle with his identity and conflicting desires) and external (the war between the Russians and the Teutonic knights). 
* **Mystery:** The story builds suspense around the protagonist's true identity and the ultimate nature of his reality. The ending leaves the reader with a lingering sense of mystery and uncertainty. 

While the story touches upon elements of **realism**, it primarily uses realistic details to ground the fantastical elements of the narrative. It does not focus on accurately depicting everyday life as the primary goal.  **Naturalism** is not a prominent feature, as the story does not delve into the deterministic aspects of nature or society as the main driving forces behind the events. Lastly, **satire** is not present, as the story does not employ humor or irony to critique society or individuals. 
"
В зеркале,1903,Bryusov,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **symbolism, modernism, gothic, mystery**.

Here's why:

* **Symbolism:** The mirror serves as a powerful symbol of duality, identity, and the unconscious. The protagonist's obsession with mirrors and the multiple reflections represent a journey into the depths of her psyche.
* **Modernism:** The text explores themes of alienation, the fragmentation of identity, and the unreliable nature of perception, all key elements of modernist literature.
* **Gothic:** The story features elements of the uncanny, a fascination with the macabre, and a blurring of the lines between reality and illusion, common in gothic fiction.
* **Mystery:** The text presents a central enigma: who is the real ""I""? The struggle between the protagonist and her reflection creates suspense and a sense of mystery surrounding the nature of their identities.

While the story contains elements of drama and psychological realism, the core themes and stylistic choices align more strongly with symbolism, modernism, the gothic, and mystery.

Декадент,1894,Bryusov,prose,"The text can be described by the following genres: **realism, symbolism, romance** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text focuses on the everyday life and struggles of young poets in 19th century Russia. It explores themes like social status, romantic relationships, and the desire for recognition, reflecting realistic concerns of the time. 
* **Symbolism:** The protagonist, a ""decadent,"" embodies the symbolist ideal of the poet as a unique individual set apart from ordinary people. The text delves into his internal struggles and search for meaning, often using symbolism and metaphor to express abstract concepts.
* **Romance:**  The core of the story revolves around the protagonist's romantic relationships with different women. The text explores the complexities of love, passion, manipulation, and disappointment, characteristic of the romance genre.

While elements of other genres may be present, they are not the primary focus:

* **Modernism:** Though published in the late 19th century, the text foreshadows some modernist themes like self-awareness and social alienation. However, it lacks the full-fledged experimentation and rejection of traditional form associated with modernism.

"
Защита,1904,Bryusov,prose,"The text has elements of the following genres: **romanticism, gothic, mystery**.

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:**  The story features a passionate, obsessive love from the narrator towards Elena, a focus on strong emotions, and a daring act (riding through a blizzard) fueled by his love. 
* **Gothic:** The tale includes a haunting presence (the ghost of Sergei), a setting in a large, isolated house, and an atmosphere of mystery and suspense. The narrator's encounter with the ghost and the eerie atmosphere contribute to the gothic element.
* **Mystery:** The story revolves around the mysterious presence of Sergei's ghost and Elena's conviction in his continued presence. The narrator's attempt to mimic the deceased and the unsettling consequences create a sense of mystery.

While the story has elements of realism (setting in a specific time and place, relatable characters), the supernatural events and heightened emotions move it beyond strict realism.  Symbolism and Modernism are less prominent, as the story focuses more on the plot and atmosphere than on intricate symbolism or experimental narrative techniques.  Satire, romance, drama, and naturalism are not primary genres of this text.

Обручение Даши,1913,Bryusov,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **realism, satire, romance, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text provides a detailed and accurate portrayal of life in 19th-century Moscow, focusing on the merchant class and their customs, beliefs, and daily routines. It explores social issues like arranged marriages, class differences, and the pursuit of wealth and social status.
* **Satire:**  The text subtly mocks the hypocrisy and materialism of the merchant class, contrasting their traditional values with their pursuit of wealth and social advancement. Characters like Vлас and his obsession with appearances are presented with a touch of irony. The character of Arkady is also satirical, representing the shallowness and pretension of some ""intellectuals"" of the time.
* **Romance:**  The text features a romantic storyline involving Даша and her desire for love and freedom. The idealized portrayal of Arkady, at least from Даша's perspective, fits the elements of a romantic narrative, even though it ultimately turns out to be a disillusioning experience.
* **Naturalism:** The text emphasizes the influence of social and economic forces on the characters' lives. Their choices are often limited by their circumstances, and the text doesn't shy away from portraying the harsh realities of their existence, such as poverty, exploitation, and domestic violence. 

While the text touches upon themes of social change and individual awakening, it doesn't fully embrace the characteristics of **modernism**. Similarly, elements of **symbolism** might be present, but they are not the defining features of the text. There are no elements of **gothic**, **drama**, or **mystery** present in the story.

Огненный ангел,1908,Bryusov,prose,"The text you provided, the preface and beginning of ""The Fiery Angel"" by Valery Bryusov, incorporates elements of several genres. The most prominent are:

**Realism, Gothic, Romance, Mystery**

**Realism:** The detailed descriptions of daily life, historical events, and intellectual debates of the 16th century ground the story in a realistic setting. The author's focus on the complexities of human psychology and his attempts to rationalize the supernatural also contribute to the realism.

**Gothic:** The presence of demonic possession, witchcraft, the occult, and dark supernatural forces evoke a strong gothic atmosphere. The exploration of the protagonist's internal struggles with faith, guilt, and desire further aligns the story with gothic themes.

**Romance:** The passionate love story between Ruprecht and Renata forms a central element of the plot.  Their intense and often tumultuous relationship, filled with longing, jealousy, and sacrifice, drives much of the narrative.

**Mystery:** The story revolves around a quest to find the missing Count Heinrich and unravel the mysteries surrounding Renata's past and her connection to the supernatural. The ambiguous nature of the events, blurring the line between reality and hallucination, adds to the sense of mystery.

"
Последние страницы из дневника женщины,1910,Bryusov,prose,"The text can be best described by these genres: **realism, modernism, drama, mystery, naturalism**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story focuses on the psychological and social realities of a woman's life, including infidelity, societal expectations, and the consequences of her actions.
* **Modernism:** The story explores themes of alienation, individual freedom, and the search for meaning in a world devoid of traditional values. The fragmented narrative and focus on inner thoughts are characteristic of modernist literature.
* **Drama:** The story is rife with conflict, heightened emotions, and intense interpersonal interactions. The protagonist's choices and their repercussions drive the plot forward, creating a dramatic arc.
* **Mystery:** The murder of the protagonist's husband serves as a central mystery, with clues and suspects emerging throughout the narrative. 
* **Naturalism:** The story portrays characters as being influenced by their environment and circumstances, showcasing how social and psychological factors shape their choices and destinies.

While elements of other genres might be present, these are the most prominent and defining aspects of the text.

"
"Рассказы Маши, с реки Мологи, под городом Устюжна",1906,Bryusov,prose,"The text is a collection of folklore and superstitions, so the genres that best describe it are: **gothic, romance** 

Here's why:

* **Gothic:** The text features elements of the supernatural, fear, and the grotesque (e.g., the descriptions of the домовой, баечник, and леший; the frightening encounters with these creatures; the dead being brought back to life).
* **Romance:** The text includes elements of the fantastical, adventurous, and mysterious (e.g., the girls summoning spirits, the descriptions of the русалка, the power of the колдуны). 

While some elements of other genres might be present, these two are the most prominent. 
"
Рея Сильвия,1914,Bryusov,prose,"The text can be best described by the following genres: **realism, romanticism, gothic**

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story depicts the harsh realities of 6th century Rome, including war, poverty, and social upheaval. The descriptions of the ruined city and the struggles of its inhabitants are grounded in historical accuracy.
* **Romanticism:** The story features elements of idealism, heightened emotion, and the glorification of the past. Maria's obsession with ancient Rome and her fantastical interpretations of history fall under this category. Her romantic love for Theodatus, set against the backdrop of a ruined palace, further adds to the romantic themes.
* **Gothic:** The story employs a gothic atmosphere through its use of dark, mysterious settings like the underground palace. The presence of decay, death (Maria's demise), and Maria's increasingly delusional state contribute to the genre's characteristic mood of suspense and  unease. 

While the story contains elements of other genres, these three are the most prominent:

* **Symbolism:**  The story has symbolic elements, particularly regarding Maria's identification with Rhea Silvia and the recurring theme of a ""new Rome."" However, these symbols are not as central as the realistic, romantic, and gothic aspects. 
* **Modernism:** The story predates the modernist movement.
* **Satire, Drama, Mystery, Naturalism:** These genres are not as evident in the story. 
"
Семь земных соблазнов,1911,Bryusov,prose,"realism, symbolism, modernism 
"
Сестры,1906,Bryusov,prose,"The genres that best describe the text are: **symbolism, modernism, gothic, drama, mystery**. 

Here's why:

* **Symbolism:** The text is full of symbolic imagery, like the snowstorm, the blood, and the recurring motif of the waltz. These symbols contribute to the overall mood and themes of the story.
* **Modernism:** The story explores themes of alienation, psychological turmoil, and the breakdown of traditional morality, which are characteristic of modernist literature. The fragmented narrative structure and stream-of-consciousness style also point to modernism.
* **Gothic:** The story features a dark, oppressive atmosphere, a sense of impending doom, and elements of the supernatural (hallucinations, visions). The gruesome discovery of the bodies and the ambiguity surrounding the events add to the gothic feel.
* **Drama:** The text is driven by intense emotional conflicts and heightened passions between the characters. The dialogue is often theatrical and reveals the characters' psychological states.
* **Mystery:** The story revolves around a crime, and the reader is left to piece together the events of the fateful night. The ambiguous ending adds to the mystery and invites different interpretations.

While the story contains elements of romance, realism, and naturalism, those genres are not the most prominent or defining characteristics of the text. Satire is not present in the story.

"
Юпитер поверженный,1934,Bryusov,prose,"The text you provided exhibits elements of **realism, romanticism, drama, and mystery**.

Here's a breakdown:

* **Realism:** The text presents a detailed portrayal of Roman society during the late 4th century, including social customs, political tensions, and religious conflicts.  
* **Romanticism:** The protagonist, Decimus Junius Norbanus, is driven by strong emotions, particularly his passionate love for Hesperia. There's a focus on individual feelings, a sense of nostalgia for the past, and a longing for an idealized Roman identity.
* **Drama:** The story unfolds through a series of intense events, conflicts, and personal struggles. The dialogue is often passionate and emotionally charged,  creating a dramatic tension. 
* **Mystery:** Elements of mystery are present, particularly surrounding Hesperia's true motives and actions. The protagonist's suspicion about his letters being read adds to the intrigue.

While the text might touch upon elements of other genres, these four are the most prominent. Notably:

* **Symbolism:** While symbolic elements might be present, they are not a defining feature of the text.
* **Modernism:**  This text predates modernism, which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
* **Gothic:** There are no elements of the supernatural, macabre, or horror associated with the Gothic genre.
* **Satire:** The text doesn't primarily aim to ridicule or criticize society, though some elements might be interpreted satirically. 
* **Romance:** While a love story is central, the text explores a broader range of themes beyond romantic love, fitting more with ""drama"" than ""romance"" as a primary genre.
* **Naturalism:** The text doesn't emphasize the deterministic forces of nature and heredity often found in naturalism. 
"
Девушка розовой калитки и муравьиный царь,1906,Blok,prose,"The text can be best described by these genres: **romanticism, symbolism, modernism, satire** 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The text emphasizes emotion, imagination, and individuality.  The narrator is clearly drawn to the ""romantic"" aspects of the German landscape and legends, even if he finds them ultimately unsatisfying. 
* **Symbolism:** The ""Girl of the Pink Gate,"" the ""Ant King,"" and the various landscapes are heavily laden with symbolic meaning, representing different approaches to life and history.
* **Modernism:** The text grapples with themes of alienation, the search for meaning in a chaotic world, and the limitations of traditional ways of thinking. There's a self-awareness and critique of both romanticism and the limitations of ""objective"" science.
* **Satire:** The narrator employs satire, particularly when describing German idealism and the romanticized view of history. He also satirizes Russian attempts to imitate Western traditions, finding them clumsy and superficial. 

While elements of other genres might be present, these four are the most prominent and defining characteristics of the text.

"Сказка о той, которая не поймет её",1907,Blok,prose,"Romanticism, Symbolism, Drama 
"
Сограждане,1918,Blok,prose,"**Realism, Satire, Modernism** 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The story depicts everyday life in a specific time and place (Russia during the revolution), focusing on mundane details like rationing cards and housing committees.
* **Satire:**  The text uses humor and exaggeration to critique the absurdity of the social and political situation.  The comparison of ""immortal souls"" to furniture, the exaggerated fear and paranoia, and the former elite now running a small shop all contribute to the satirical tone.
* **Modernism:** The story reflects modernist themes of alienation, disillusionment, and the breakdown of traditional values. The protagonist's uncertainty about his own citizenship and his detachment from the political fervor around him are indicative of a modernist sensibility. 

**Why the other genres are less fitting:**

* **Romanticism:**  The story lacks the idealized characters, emotional intensity, and focus on nature typical of Romanticism.
* **Symbolism:** While some symbolic interpretation is possible, the text doesn't heavily rely on symbols to convey its meaning.
* **Gothic:** There are no elements of horror, supernatural, or macabre associated with Gothic literature.
* **Romance:**  The story doesn't center on a romantic relationship. 
* **Drama:** While there's a sense of tension and conflict, the text doesn't unfold primarily through dialogue and action as in a drama. 
* **Mystery:** There's no central puzzle or crime to be solved.
* **Naturalism:** While the story depicts social realities, it doesn't focus on the deterministic forces of nature and heredity that are central to Naturalism.

Дубровский,1833,Pushkin,prose,"The text you provided is an excerpt from the novel *Dubrovsky* by Alexander Pushkin. Here are the genres that best describe it:

**Romanticism, Drama, Romance, Mystery** 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The story features strong emotions, a focus on individualism (Dubrovsky's rebellion), and themes of love, revenge, and social injustice, all hallmarks of Romanticism. 
* **Drama:** There are intense conflicts, heightened stakes, and dramatic events like the fire, the court case, and the abduction attempt, creating a strong sense of drama.
* **Romance:** A central plotline revolves around the love story between Vladimir Dubrovsky and Marya Kirilovna, with forbidden love, secret meetings, and a dramatic climax.
* **Mystery:** The identity and motives of Dubrovsky, as well as his methods of evading capture, add elements of mystery and intrigue to the story. 

While the story has some realistic elements, it leans more heavily on romantic conventions and dramatic storytelling. The other genres (symbolism, modernism, gothic, satire, naturalism) are not as prominent or present in the excerpt. 
"
Египетские ночи,1835,Pushkin,prose,"**Romanticism, Drama, Satire** 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:** The text emphasizes the emotional intensity of the poet, the power of imagination, and the allure of exotic themes (Egypt, Cleopatra). The focus on the individual artist and his struggles aligns with Romantic ideals.
* **Drama:** The scene is set like a play, with a clear setting, characters, and dialogue. The anticipation of the improvisation and the emotional reactions of the characters create dramatic tension. 
* **Satire:** Pushkin uses humor to critique the superficiality of the Russian aristocracy and the pretensions of the poet, Чарский (Charsky).  Charsky's attempts to distance himself from the ""stigma"" of being a poet are depicted with a biting irony. 

**Why the others don't fit as well:**

* **Realism:** While the story has elements of social commentary, it's not primarily concerned with portraying everyday life in a realistic manner.
* **Symbolism:** The text doesn't heavily rely on symbols to convey deeper meaning. 
* **Modernism:**  This text predates the modernist movement, which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
* **Gothic:**  The story lacks the elements of horror, supernatural, and decay characteristic of the Gothic genre.
* **Mystery:** There is no central mystery to be solved.
* **Naturalism:** Naturalism focuses on scientific observation and social determinism, which are not central to this story. 
"
История Пугачёва,1834,Pushkin,prose,"The text you provided is a historical account of the Pugachev rebellion. Based on the content and style, here are the applicable genres:

**Realism, Naturalism** 

* **Realism:** The text focuses on historical events and real people, aiming to portray them accurately and without idealization. 
* **Naturalism:**  The text often delves into the harsh realities of the rebellion, depicting violence, poverty, and the motivations of the people involved.  

Let's examine why other genres are **less fitting:**

* **Romanticism:** While there's potential for romanticizing a rebel figure like Pugachev, Pushkin's account prioritizes historical detail over emotional or idealized portrayals.
* **Symbolism:** The text doesn't heavily rely on symbols or metaphorical language to convey deeper meanings.
* **Modernism:** This genre emerged much later and is characterized by experimentation with form and a break from traditional narratives. Pushkin's writing adheres to more conventional storytelling.
* **Gothic:** This genre typically involves elements of the supernatural, horror, and decay, which are absent in this historical account. 
* **Satire:** While there might be subtle satirical elements in the portrayal of some officials, satire is not the primary mode of the text.
* **Romance:** This genre focuses on love and relationships, which are present but not central to the narrative of the rebellion.
* **Drama:** The text is written as a historical account, not a play intended for performance.
* **Mystery:** While there's initial uncertainty about Pugachev's identity, the text primarily focuses on documenting the events of the rebellion rather than building suspense around an unsolved mystery. 
"

"
Капитанская дочка,1833,Pushkin,prose,"The genres that best describe ""The Captain's Daughter"" are: **realism, romance, drama, mystery**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** Pushkin portrays the historical setting of the Pugachev Rebellion with detail and accuracy, depicting the social conditions, political climate, and even the harsh realities of war.
* **Romance:** The story revolves around the love between Grinev and Masha, facing obstacles and dangers in a dramatic setting. There's a strong emphasis on their emotions, devotion, and personal sacrifices for each other. 
* **Drama:** The narrative is filled with high stakes, intense situations like the siege, capture, and near-execution, and strong emotional responses from the characters. The conflicts between duty and love, loyalty and betrayal contribute to the dramatic element.
* **Mystery:**  The true identity of Pugachev and his connection to Grinev create an element of mystery, especially in the early chapters. The intrigue surrounding Shvabrin's motivations and actions also adds a layer of suspense.

While the text has elements of satire, they are not prominent enough to classify the entire work as satire. Symbolism, modernism, gothic, and naturalism are not significant aspects of ""The Captain's Daughter"".

"
Пиковая дама,1833,Pushkin,prose,"The best descriptors for ""The Queen of Spades"" by Alexander Pushkin are: **romanticism, gothic, mystery** 

Here's why:

* **Romanticism:**  The story emphasizes intense emotion, individualism (Hermann's ambition), and the supernatural (the ghost of the Countess). It also features a Byronic hero in Hermann – driven, passionate, and ultimately tragic.
* **Gothic:** The story utilizes classic gothic tropes: a haunting presence (the Countess's ghost), a dark and mysterious secret (the three cards), and a setting that includes an old mansion and a sense of decay.
* **Mystery:** The narrative revolves around a central mystery – the secret of the three cards. The plot is driven by Hermann's quest to uncover and exploit this secret, leading to suspense and intrigue.

While the story contains elements of other genres:

* **Realism:**  The text does ground itself somewhat in the realities of gambling and social hierarchy in Russia, but the fantastical elements ultimately overshadow a purely realistic approach.
* **Symbolism:** The Queen of Spades itself carries symbolic weight, representing both fate and Hermann's obsession, but symbolism is not the dominant force driving the narrative.
* **Modernism, Satire, Romance, Drama, Naturalism:** These genres are less present in the overall themes and style of the story. 
"
Повести Белкина,1830,Pushkin,prose,"The genres that best describe the text above are **realism, romanticism, satire, romance**. 

Here's why:

* **Realism:** The text depicts everyday life and situations, especially in rural Russia, with a focus on ordinary people like stationmasters, undertakers, and young gentry.
* **Romanticism:** The stories often feature strong emotions, passionate love affairs, dramatic events (duels, elopements, blizzards), and the exploration of individual feelings and inner conflicts. 
* **Satire:** The text sometimes employs humor and irony to critique social norms, class differences, and human follies, particularly seen in ""The Undertaker"" and ""The Stationmaster.""
* **Romance:**  Several stories center around love affairs, courtship rituals, and the pursuit of romantic ideals, even amidst social obstacles or unexpected twists.

Let's look at why the other genres are less fitting:

* **Symbolism:** While some symbolic elements might be present, the text doesn't rely heavily on complex symbolism to convey its meaning. 
* **Modernism:** This text predates modernism, which typically involves experimentation with form, narrative, and a questioning of traditional values.
* **Gothic:** The stories lack the elements of the gothic genre, such as supernatural occurrences, dark and mysterious atmospheres, or intense psychological terror.
* **Drama:** While the stories have dramatic elements, they are written as prose narratives, not plays.
* **Mystery:** While some stories contain suspenseful elements, they are not primarily focused on solving a crime or unraveling a puzzle.
* **Naturalism:** Naturalism emphasizes social determinism and a detached, scientific observation of human behavior, which isn't the primary focus of these stories.
